12 June. The horrible spells lately, innumerable, almost without interruption.
Walks, nights, days, incapable of anything but pain. 
And yet. No ‘and yet’, no matter how anxiously and tensely you look at me;
Krizanovskaya on the picture postcard in front of me. 
More and more fearful as I write. It is understandable. Every word, twisted in
the hands of the spirits - this twist of the hand is their characteristic gesture -
becomes a spear turned against the speaker. Most especially a remark like this.
And so ad infinitum. The only consolation would be: it happens whether you like
or no. And what you like is of infinitesimally little help. More than consolation
is: You too have weapons.
