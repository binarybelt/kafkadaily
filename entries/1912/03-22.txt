22 March. (The last few days I have been writing down the wrong dates.)
Baum's lecture in the lecture hall. G. F., nineteen years old, getting married
next week. Dark, faultless, slender face. Distended nostrils. For years she has
been wearing hats and clothes styled like a hunter's. The same dark-green
gleam on her face. The strands of hair running along the cheeks, just as in
general a slight down seems to cover all her face which she has bowed down
into the darkness. Points of her elbows resting lightly on the arms of her chair.
Then on the Wenzels-platz a brisk bow, completed with little energy, a turn, and
a drawing erect of the poorly dressed, slender body. I looked at her much less
often than I wanted to.
