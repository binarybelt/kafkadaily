9 May. Yesterday evening in the coffee-house with Pick. How I hold fast to my
novel 48 against all restlessness, like a figure on a monument that looks into the
distance and holds fast to its pedestal. 
Hopeless evening with the family today. My brother-in-law needs money for
the factory, my father is upset because of my sister, because of the business
and because of his heart, my unhappy second sister, my mother unhappy
about all of them, and I with my scribblings.
