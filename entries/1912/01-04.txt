4 January. It is only because of my vanity that I like so much to read to my
sisters (so that today, for instance, it is already too late to write). Not that I am
convinced that I shall achieve something significant in the reading, it is only
that I ain dominated by the passion to get so close to the good works I read
that I merge with them, not through my own merit, indeed, but only through
the attentiveness of my listening sisters, which has been excited by what is
being read and is unresponsive to inessentials; and therefore too, under the
concealment my vanity affords me, I can share as creator in the effect which
the work alone has exercised. That is why I really read admirably to my sisters
and stress the accents with extreme exactness just as I feel them, because later
I am abundantly rewarded not only by myself but also by my sisters. 
But if I read to Brod or Baum or others, just because of my pretensions my
reading must appear horribly bad to everyone, even if they know nothing of
the usual quality of my reading; for here I know that the listener is fully aware
of the separation between me and what is being read, here I cannot merge
completely with what I read without becoming ridiculous in my own opinion,
an opinion which can expect no support from the listener; with my voice I
flutter around what is being read, try to force my way in here and there
because they don't expect that much from me at all; but what they really want
me to do, to read without vanity, calmly and distantly, and to become
passionate only when a genuine passion demands it, that I cannot do; but
although I believe that I have resigned myself to reading badly to everyone
except my sisters, my vanity, which this time has no justification, still shows
itself: I feel offended if anyone finds fault with my reading, I become flushed
and want to read oa quickly, just as I usually strive, once I have begun, to read
on endlessly, out of an unconscious yearning that during the course of the long
reading there may be produced, at least in me, that vain, false feeling of
integration with what I read which makes me forget that I shall never be strong
enough at any one moment to impose my feelings on the clear vision of the
listener and that at home it is always my sisters who initiate this longed-for
substitution.
