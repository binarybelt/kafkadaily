24 January. Wednesday. For the following reasons have not written for so
long: I was angry with my boss and cleared it up only by means of a good
letter; was in the factory several times; read, and indeed greedily, Pines's
VHistoire da la litterature Judeo-Allemande, 500 pages, with such thoroughness,
haste, and joy as I have never yet shown in the case of similar books; now I am
reading Fromer, Organistnus des Judentums; finally I spent a lot of time with the
Jewish actors, wrote letters for them, prevailed on the Zionist society to inquire
of the Zionist societies of Bohemia whether they would like to have guest
appearances of the troupe; I wrote the circular that was required and had it
reproduced; saw Sulamith once more and Richter's Herzele Mejiches for the first
time, was at the folksong evening of the Bar Kokhba Society, and day before
yesterday saw Graf von Gleichen by Schmidtbonn. 
Folksong evening: Dr Nathan Birnbaum is the lecturer. Jewish habit of
inserting ‘my dear ladies and gentlemen’ or just ‘my dear’ at every pause in the
talk. Was repeated at the beginning of Birnbaum's talk to the point of being
ridiculous. But from what I know of Lowy I think that these recurrent
expressions, which are frequently found in ordinary Yiddish conversations too,
such as ‘Weh ist mirV or ‘S'ist nischt or ‘S'ist viel zu reden’ are not intended to
cover up embarrassment but are rather intended, like ever-fresh springs, to stir
up the sluggish stream of speech that is never fluent enough for the Jewish
temperament.
