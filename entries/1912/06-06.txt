6 June. Thursday. Corpus Christi. Two horses in a race, how one lowers its
head out of the race and shakes its mane vigorously, then raises its head and
only now, apparently feeling better, resumes die race which it has never really
interrupted. 
I have just read in Flaubert's letters: ‘My novel is the cliff on which I am
hanging, and I know nothing of what is going on in the world' -Like what I
noted down about myself on 9 May. 
Without weight, without bones, without body, walked through die streets for
two hours considering what I overcame this afternoon while writing.
