17 March. During these days read Morgenrot by Stossl. 46 
Max's concert Sunday. My almost unconscious listening. From now on I can
no longer be bored by music. I no longer seek, as I did in vain in the past, to
penetrate this impenetrable circle which immediately forms about me together
with the music, I am also careful not to jump over it, which I probably could do,
but instead I remain calmly in my thoughts that develop and subside in this
narrowed space without it being possible for disturbing self-observations to
step into their slow swarm. The beautiful ‘magic circle' (by Max) that seems
here and there to open the breast of the singer. 
Goethe, ‘Trost in Tranen.' Alles geben die Goiter, die unendlichen, Ihren
Lieblingen ganz: Alle Freuden, die unendlichen, Alle Schmerzetij die unendlichen,
ganz. 
My incompetence in the presence of my mother, in the presence of Miss T.,
and in the presence of all those in the Continental at that time and later on the
street. 
ManCzelle Nitouche on Monday. The good effect of a French word in a dreary
German performance. Boarding-school girls in bright dresses, with their arms
outstretched, run into the garden behind a fence. Barracks-yard of the dragoonregiment at night. Some officers in a barracks in the background are having a
farewell celebration in a hall that is reached by going up a few steps. Mam'zelle
Nitouche enters and is persuaded by love and recklessness to take part in the
celebration. The sort of thing that can happen to a girl! In the morning at the
convent, in the evening a substitute for an operetta singer who couldn't come,
and at night in the dragoons' barracks. 
Today, painfully tired, spent the afternoon on the sofa.
