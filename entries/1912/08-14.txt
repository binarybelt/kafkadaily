14 August. Letter to Rowohlt. 
Dear Mr Rowohlt,I am enclosing the little prose pieces you wanted to see; they will probably be
enough to make up a small book. While I was putting them together towards
this end, I sometimes had to choose between satisfying my sense of
responsibility and an eagerness to have a book among your beautiful books.
Certainly I did not in each instance make an entirely clear-cut decision. But now
I should naturally be happy if the things pleased you sufficiently to print them.
After all, even with the greatest skill and the greatest understanding the bad in
them is not discernible at first sight. Isn't what is most universally individual in
writers the fact that each conceals his bad qualities in an entirely different way? 
Faithfully–
