25 September. By force kept myself from writing. Tossed in bed. The
congestion of blood in my head and the useless drifting by of things. What
harmfulness! - Yesterday read at Baum's, to the Baum family, my sisters, Marta,
Dr Block's wife, and her two sons (one of them a one-year volunteer in the
army). Towards the end my hand was moving uncontrollably about and actually
before my face. There were tears in my eyes. The indubitability of the story was
confirmed - This evening tore myself away from my writing. Films in the
National Theatre. Miss O., whom a clergyman once pursued. She came home
soaked in cold sweat. Danzig. Life of Korner. The horses. The white horse. The
smoke of powder. ‘Liitzows wilde Jagd.' 53
