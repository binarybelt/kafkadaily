28 March. From Mrs Fanta's lecture, ‘Impressions of Berlin’: Grillparzer once
didn't want to go to a party because he knew that Hebbel, with whom he was
friendly, would also be there. ‘He will question me again about my opinion on
God, and when I don't know what to say, he will become rude' - My awkward
behaviour.
