5 September. I ask him: How is one to reconcile the fact that you are generally
dissatisfied, as you recently said, and that nevertheless you are at home
everywhere, as can be seen time and again (and which is revealed in the
rudeness always characteristic of this sort of being-at-home, I thought). He
answers, as I remember it: ‘In individual things I am dissatisfied, this doesn't
extend to the whole. I often dine in a little French pension that is very exclusive
and expensive. For example, a room for a couple, with meals, costs fifty francs
a day. So I sit there between the secretary of the French legation, for example,
and a Spanish general of artillery. Opposite me sit a high official of the navyministry and some count or other. I know them all well by now, sit down in my
place, greeting them on all sides, because I am in a peculiar mood I say not
another word until the good-bye with which I take my leave. Then I am alone
on the street and really can't see what purpose this evening served. I go home
and regret that I didn't marry. Naturally this mood passes away again, whether
because I have thought it through to the end, whether because the thoughts
have dispersed. But on occasion it comes back again.'
