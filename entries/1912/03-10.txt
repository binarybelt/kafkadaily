10 March. Sunday. He seduced a girl in a small place in the Iser mountains
where he spent a summer to restore his delicate lungs. After a brief effort to
persuade her, incomprehensibly, the way lung cases sometimes act, he threw
the girl - his landlord's daughter, who liked to walk with him in the evening after
work - down in the grass on the river bank and took her as she lay there
unconscious with fright. Later he had to carry water from the river in his
cupped hands and pour it over the girl's face to restore her. ‘Julie, but Julie,' he
said countless times, bending over her. He was ready to accept complete
responsibility for his offence and was only making an effort to make himself
realize how serious his situation was. Without thinking about it he could not
have realized it. The simple girl who lay before him, now breathing regularly
again, her eyes still closed because of fear and embarrassment, could make no
difficulty for him; with the tip of his toe, he, the great, strong person, could
push the girl aside. She was weak and plain, could what had happened to her
have any significance that would last even until tomorrow? Would not anyone
who compared the two of them have to come to this conclusion? The river
stretched calmly between the meadows and fields to the distant hills. There
was still sunshine only on the slope of the opposite shore. The last clouds were
drifting out of that clear evening sky. 
Nothing, nothing. This is the way I raise up ghosts before me. I was involved,
even if only superficially, only in the passage, ‘Later he had….' mostly in the
‘pour’. For a moment I thought I saw something real in the description of thelandscape. 
So deserted by myself, by everything. Noise in the next room.
