2 June. Wrote almost nothing. 

Yesterday lecture on America by Dr Soukup. (The Czechs in Nebraska, all
officials in America are elected, everyone must belong to one of the three
parties - Republican, Democratic, Socialist - Roosevelt's election meeting, with
his glass he threatened a farmer who had made an objection, street speakers
who carry a small box with them to serve as a platform.) Then spring festival,
met Paul Kisch who talked about his dissertation, ‘Hebrew and the Czechs’.
