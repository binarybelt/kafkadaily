12 September. This evening Dr L. at our house. Another emigrant to Palestine.
Is taking his bar examination a year before the end of his clerkship and is
leaving (in two weeks) for Palestine with 1,200 K. Will try to get a position with
the Palestine Office. All these emigrants to Palestine (Dr B., Dr K.) have
downcast eyes, feel blinded by their listeners, fumble around on the table with
the tips of their extended fingers, their voices quiver, they smile weakly and
prop up these smiles with a little irony. Dr K. told us that his students are
chauvinists, have the Maccabees forever in their mouths and want to take after
them. 
I became aware that I wrote so eagerly and well to Dr Schiller only because
Miss B. stopped in Breslau, and I have been thinking about sending flowers to
her through Dr Schiller, and although all this was two weeks ago, a trace of it is
still in the air.
