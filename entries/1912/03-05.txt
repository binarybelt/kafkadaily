5 March. These revolting doctors! Businesslike, determined and so ignorant
of healing that, if this businesslike determination were to leave them, they
would stand at sick-beds like schoolboys. I wished I had the strength to found a
nature-cure society. By scratching around in my sister's ear Dr K. turns aninflammation of the eardrum into an inflammation of the inner ear; the maid
collapses while fixing the fire; with the quick diagnosis which is his custom in
the case of maids, the doctor declares it to be an upset stomach and a resulting
congestion of blood. The next day she takes to her bed again, has a high fever;
the doctor turns her from side to side, affirms it is angina, and runs away so
that the next moment will not refute him. Even dares to speak of the ‘vulgarly
violent reaction of this girl’, which is true to this extent, that he is used to
people whose physical condition is worthy of his curative power and is
produced by it, and he feels insulted, more than he is aware, by the strong
nature of this country girl. 
Yesterday at Baum's. Read Der Damon. Total impression unfriendly. Good,
precise mood on the way up to Baum's, died down immediately I got up there,
embarrassment in the presence of the child. 
Sunday: In the Continental, at the card-players’. Journalisten with Kramer first,
one and a half acts. A good deal of forced merriment can be seen in Bolz, which
produces, indeed, a little that is really delicate. Met Miss Taussig in front of the
theatre in the intermission after the second act. Ran to the cloakroom,
returned with cloak flying, and escorted her home.
