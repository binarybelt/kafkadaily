9 August. The upset night. Yesterday the maid who said to the little boy on
the steps, ‘Hold on to my skirt!' 

My inspired reading aloud of Der arme Spieltnann. The perception in this story
of what is manly in Grillparzer. The way he can risk everything and risks
nothing, because there is nothing but truth in him already, a truth that even in
the face of the contradictory impressions of the moment will justify itself as
such when the crucial time arrives. The calm self-possession. The slow pace
that neglects nothing. The immediate readiness, when it is needed, not sooner,
for long in advance he sees everything that is coming.
