15 August. Wasted day. Spent sleeping and lying down. Feast of St Mary on
the Altstadter Ring. The man with a voice that seemed to come from a hole in
the ground. Thought much of - what embarrassment before writing down
names - F. B. 51 O. has just been reciting poems by Goethe. She chooses them
with right feeling. ‘Trost in Tranen’. ‘An Lotte’. ‘An Werther’. ‘An den Mond' 
Again read old diaries instead of keeping away from them. I live as irrationally
as is at all possible. And the publication of the thirty-one pages is to blame for
everything. Even more to blame, of course, is my weakness, which permits a
thing of this sort to influence me. Instead of shaking myself, I sit here and
consider how I could express all this as insultingly as possible. But my horrible
calm interferes with my inventiveness. I am curious as to how I shall find a way
out of this state. I don't permit others to push me, nor do I know which is ‘the
right path’. So what will happen? Have I finally run aground, a great mass in
shallow water? In that case, however, I should at least be able to turn my head.
That's what I do, however.
