8 April. Saturday before Easter. Complete knowledge of oneself. To be able to
seize the whole of one's abilities like a little ball. To accept the greatest decline
as something familiar and so still remain elastic in it. 
Desire for a deeper sleep that dissolves more. The metaphysical urge is only
the urge toward death. 
How affectedly I spoke today in Haas's 47 presence because he praised Max's
and my travel report, so that in this way, at least, I might make myself worthy
of the praise that the report does not warrant, or so that I might continue by
fraud the fraudulent or lying effect of the travel report, or in the spirit of Haas's
amiable lie, which I tried to make easier for him.
