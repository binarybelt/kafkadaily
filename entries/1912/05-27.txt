27 May. Yesterday Whit Sunday, cold weather, a not very nice excursion with
Max and Weltsch. In the evening, coffee-house, Werfel gives me Besuch aus
dem Elysium. 
Part of Niklasstrasse and all the bridge turns around to look sentimentally at
a dog who, loudly barking, is chasing an ambulance. Until suddenly the dog
stops, turns away and proves to be an ordinary, strange dog who meant
nothing in particular by his pursuit of the vehicle.
