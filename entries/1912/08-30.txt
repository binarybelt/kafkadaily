30 August. All this time did nothing. The visit of my uncle from Spain. Last
Saturday in the Arco Werfel recited his ‘Lebenslieder' and ‘Opfer’. A monster!But I looked him in the eye and held it all evening. 
It will be hard to rouse me, and yet I am restless. When I lay in bed this
afternoon and someone quickly turned a key in the lock, for a moment I had
locks all over my body, as though at a fancy-dress ball, and at short intervals a
lock was opened or shut here and there. 
Questionnaire by the magazine Miroir, about love in the present and the way
love has changed since the days of our grandparents. An actress answered:
Never did they love as well as today. 
How shaken and exalted I was after hearing Werfel! How I behaved
afterwards at L.'s party, wild, almost, and without a fault. 
This month, which, because of the absence of the boss, could have been put
to exceptionally good use, I have wasted and slept away without much excuse
(sending the book off to Rowohlt, abscesses, my uncle's visit). Even this
afternoon I stretched out on the bed for three hours with dreamy excuses.
