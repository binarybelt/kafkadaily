Comparison by Rachilde: Those who rejoice in the sun and demand that others

Letter to Weltsch, proposed that we use ‘Du' to one another. Yesterday a good
letter to Uncle Alfred about the factory. Day before yesterday letter to Lowy. 
Now, in the evening, out of boredom, washed my hands in the bathroom

A few days ago an excellent lecture by Davis Trietsch on colonization in
Palestine.
