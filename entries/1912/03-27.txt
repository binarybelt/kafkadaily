27 March. Monday, on the street. The boy who, with several others, threw a
large ball at a servant girl walking defencelessly in front of them; just as the
ball was flying at the girl's behind I grabbed him by the throat, choked him in
fury, thrust him aside, and swore. Then walked on and didn't even look at the
girl. One quite forgets one's earthly existence because one is so entirely full of
fury and is permitted to believe that, given the opportunity, one would in the
same way fill oneself with even more beautiful emotions.
