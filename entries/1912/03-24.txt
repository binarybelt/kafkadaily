24 March. Sunday, yesterday. Die Sternenbraut by Christian von Ehrenfels -
Lost in watching. The sick officer in the play. The sick body in the tight uniform
that made health and decisiveness a duty. 
In the morning in the bright sun at Max's for half an hour. 
In the next room my mother is entertaining the L. couple. They are talking
about vermin and corns. (Mrs L. has six corns on each toe.) It is easy to see that
there is no real progress made in conversations of this sort. It is informationthat will be forgotten again by both and that even now proceeds along in self
forgetfulness without any sense of responsibility. But for the very reason that
such conversations are unthinkable without absent-mindedness, they reveal
empty spaces which, if one insists, can be filled only by thinking, or, better yet,
by dreams.
