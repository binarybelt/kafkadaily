18 September. H.'s stories yesterday in the office. The stone breaker on the
highway who begged a frog from him, held it by the feet, and with three bites
swallowed down first the little head, then the rump, and finally the feet - The
best way to kill cats, who cling stubbornly to life: Squeeze their throats in a
closed door and pull their tails - His horror of vermin. In the army one night he
had an itch under his nose, he slapped it in his sleep and crushed something.
But the something was a bedbug and he carried the stench of it around with
him for days. 
Four people ate a well-prepared roast cat, but only three knew what they
were eating. After the meal the three began to meow, but the fourth refused to
believe it, only when they showed him the bloody skin did he believe it, could
not run out fast enough to vomit everything up again, and was very sick for
two weeks. 
This stone breaker ate nothing but bread and whatever else in the way of
fruit or living flesh that he accidentally came upon, and drank nothing but
brandy. Slept in the shed of a brickyard. Once H. met him at twilight in the
fields. ‘Stand still,' the man said, ‘or …' For the sport of it, H. stopped. ‘Give me
your cigarette,' the man went on. H. gave it to him. ‘Give me another one!' - ‘So
you want another one?' H. asked him, held his gnarled stick in his left hand in
case of trouble, and struck him in the face with his right so that he dropped the
cigarette. The man ran away at once, cowardly and weak, the way such brandy
drinkers are. 
Yesterday at B.'s with Dr L. Song about Reb Dovidl, Reb Dovidl of Vassilko is
going to Talne today. In a city between Vassilko and Talne they sing it
indifferently, in Vassilko weepingly, in Talne happily.
