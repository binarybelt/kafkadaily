8 March. Day before yesterday was blamed because of the factory. Then for
an hour on the sofa thought about jumping-out-of-the-window. 
Yesterday, Harden lecture on ‘The Theatre’. Apparently entirely impromptu; I
was in a fairly good mood and therefore did not find it as empty as did the
others. Began well: ‘At this hour in which we have met together here to discuss
the theatre, the curtain is rising in every theatre of Europe and the other
continents to reveal the stage to the audience.' With an electric light attached
to a stand in front of him at the level of his breast so that it can be moved
about, he lights up the front of his shirt as though it were on display, and
during the course of the lecture he changes the lighting by moving the light.
Toe-dancing to make himself taller, as well as to tighten up his talent for
improvisation. Trousers tight even around the groin. A short tail-coat like that
tacked on to a doll. Almost strained, serious face, sometimes like an old lady's,sometimes like Napoleon's. Fading colour of his forehead as of a wig. Probably
corseted. 
Read through some old notebooks. It takes all my strength to last it out. The
unhappiness one must suffer when one interrupts oneself in a task that can
never succeed except all at once, and this is what has always happened to me
until now; in rereading one must re-experience this unhappiness in a more
concentrated way though not as strongly as before. 
Today, while bathing, I thought I felt old powers, as though they had been
untouched by the long interval.
