11 September. The evening of the day before yesterday with Utitz. 
A dream: I found myself on a jetty of square-cut stones built far out into the
sea. Someone, or even several people, were with me, but my awareness of
myself was so strong that I hardly knew more about them than that I was
speaking to them. I can remember only the raised knees of someone sitting
near me. At first I did not really know where I was, only when once I
accidentally stood up did I see on my left and behind me on my right the
distant, clearly outlined sea with many battleships lined up in rows and at
anchor. On the right New York could be seen, we were in New York Harbour.
The sky was grey, but of a constant brightness. I moved back and forth in my
seat, freely exposed to the air on all sides, in order to be able to see everything.
In the direction of New York my glance slanted downwards a little, in the
direction of the sea it slanted upwards. I now noticed the water rise up near us
in high waves on which was borne a great cosmopolitan traffic. I can
remember only that instead of the rafts we have, there were long timbers
lashed together into gigantic bundles the cut ends of which kept popping out
of the water during the voyage, higher or lower, according to the height of the
waves, and at the same time kept turning end over end in the water. I sat downdrew up my feet, quivered with pleasure, virtually dug myself into the ground
in delight, and said: Really, this is even more interesting than the traffic on a
Paris boulevard.
