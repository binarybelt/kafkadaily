20 August. Outside my window, across the university building site partly
overgrown with weeds, the little boys, both in blue blouses, one in light blue,
the other, smaller one in darker blue, are each carrying a bundle of dry hay that
fills their arms. They struggle up a slope with it. Charm of it all for the eyes. 
This morning the empty open wagon and the large, emaciated horse pulling
it. Both, making a final effort to get up a slope, stretched out to an unusual
length. Seen at an angle by the spectator. The horse, front legs raised a little,
his neck stretched sideways and upwards. Over him the whip of the driver. 
If Rowohlt would send it back and I could lock it up again as if it had all never
happened, so that I should be only as unhappy as I was before. 
Miss F. B. When I arrived at Brod's on 13 August, she was sitting at the table. I
was not at all curious about who she was, but rather took her for granted at
once. Bony, empty face that wore its emptiness openly. Bare throat. A blouse
thrown on. Looked very domestic in her dress although, as it later turned out,
she by no means was. (I alienate myself from her a little by inspecting her so
closely. What a state I'm in now, indeed, alienated in general from the whole of
everything good, and don't even believe it yet. If the literary talk at Max's
doesn't distract me too much, I'll try to write the story about Blenkelt today. It
needn't be long, but I must hit it off right.) Almost broken nose. Blonde,
somewhat straight, unattractive hair, strong chin. As I was taking my seat I
looked at her closely for the first time, by the time I was seated I already had an
unshakeable opinion.
