9 July. Nothing written for so long. Begin tomorrow. Otherwise I shall again
get into a prolonged, irresistible dissatisfaction; I am really in it already. The
nervous states are beginning. But if I can do something, then I can do it
without superstitious precautions. 
The invention of the devil. If we are possessed by the devil, it cannot be by
one, for then we should live, at least here on earth, quiedy, as with God, in
unity, without contradiction, without reflection, always sure of the man behind
us. His face would not frighten us, for as diabolical beings we would, if
somewhat sensitive to the sight, be clever enough to prefer to sacrifice a hand
in order to keep his face covered with it. If we were possessed by only a single
devil, one who had a calm, untroubled view of our whole nature, and freedom
to dispose of us at any moment, then that devil would also have enough power
to hold us for the length of a human life high above the spirit of God in us, and
even to swing us to and fro, so that we should never get to see a glimmer of it
and therefore should not be troubled from that quarter. Only a crowd of devils
could account for our earthly misfortunes. Why don't they exterminate one
another until only a single one is left, or why don't they subordinate themselves
to one great devil? Either way would be in accord with the diabolical principle
of deceiving us as completely as possible. With unity lacking, of what use is the
scrupulous attention all the devils pay us? It simply goes without saying that
the falling of a human hair must matter more to the devil than to God, since
the devil really loses that hair and God does not. But we still do not arrive at
any state of well-being so long as the many devils are within us.
