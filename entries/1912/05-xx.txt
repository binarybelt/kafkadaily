May. Yesterday a wonderfully beautiful evening with Max. If I love myself, I
love him more. Cabaret Lucerna. Madame la mort by Rachilde. Dream of a SpringMorning. The gay, fat girl in the box. The wild one with the coarse nose, her face
smudged with soot, her shoulders squeezed up out of her dress (which wasn't
dacollete, however) and her back twisted to and fro, her simple, blue blouse
with white polka dots, her fencer's glove, which was always visible since most
of the time her right hand was either resting flat, or on its fingertips, on the
right thigh of her lively mother seated beside her. Her braids twisted over her
ears, a not-too-clean light-blue ribbon on the back of her head, the hair in front
encircles her forehead in a thin but compact tuft that projects far out in front.
Her warm, wrinkled, light cloak carelessly falling in folds when she was
negotiating at the box office.
