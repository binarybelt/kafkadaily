13 February. I am beginning to write the lecture for Lowy's performance. It is
on Sunday, the 18th. I shall not have much time to prepare and am really
striking up a kind of recitative here as though in an opera. The reason is only
that an incessant excitement has been oppressing me for days and that,
somewhat hesitant in the face of the actual beginning of the lecture, I want to
write down a few words only for myself; in that way, given a little momentum, I
shall be able to stand up before the audience. Cold and heat alternate in me
with the successive words of the sentence, I dream melodic rises and falls, I
read sentences of Goethe's as though my whole body were running down the
stresses.
