12 March. In the tram-car rapidly passing by there sat in a corner, his cheek
against the window, his left arm stretched along the back of the seat, a young
man with an unbuttoned overcoat billowing around him, looking down the
long, empty bench. Today he had become engaged and he could think of
nothing else. His being engaged made him feel comfortable and with this
feeling he sometimes looked casually up at the ceiling of the tram. When the
conductor came to sell him his ticket, after some jingling, he easily found the
right coin, with a single motion put it into the conductor's hand, and seized the
ticket between two fingers held open like a pair of scissors. There was no real
connexion between him and the tram-car and it would not have been
surprising if, without using the platform or steps, he had appeared on the
street and gone his way on foot with the same look. 
Only the billowing overcoat remains, everything else is made up.
