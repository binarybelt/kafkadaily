8 February. Goethe: ‘My delight in creating was infinite.' 
I have become more nervous, weaker, and have lost a large part of the calm
on which I prided myself years ago. Today, when I received the card from Baum
in which he writes that he cannot give the talk at the evening for the Eastern
Jews after all, and when I was therefore compelled to think that I should have
to take it over, I was overpowered by uncontrollable twitchings, the pulsing of
my arteries sprang along my body like little flames; if I sat down, my knees
trembled under the table and I had to press my hands together. I shall, of
course, give a good lecture, that is certain, besides, the restlessness itself,
heightened to an extreme on that evening, will pull me together in such a way
that there will not be room for restlessness and the talk will come straight outof me as though out of a gun barrel. But it is possible that I shall collapse after
it, in any event I shall not be able to get over it for a long time. So little physical
strength! Even these few words are written under the influence of weakness. 
Yesterday evening with Lowy at Baum's. My liveliness. Recently Lowy
translated a bad Hebrew story, ‘The Eye’, at Baum's.
