11 August. Nothing, nothing. How much time the publishing of the little book
takes from me and how much harmful, ridiculous pride comes from reading
old things with an eye to publication. Only that keeps me from writing. And yet
in reality I have achieved nothing, the disturbance is the best proof of it. In any
event, now, after the publication of the book, I will have to stay away from
magazines and reviews even more than before, if I do not wish to be content
with just sticking the tips of my fingers into the truth. How immovable I have
become! Formerly, if I said only one word that opposed the direction of the
moment, I at once flew over to the other side, now I simply look at myself and
remain as I am.
