9 January. Superstition and principle and what makes life possible: Through a
heaven of vice a hell of virtue is reached. So easily? So dirtily? So unbelievably?
Superstition is easy. 
A segment has been cut out of the back of his head. The sun, and the whole
world with it, peep in. It makes him nervous, it distracts him from his work, and
moreover it irritates him that just he should be the one to be debarred from
the spectacle. 
        It is no disproof of one's presentiment of an ultimate liberation if the next day
one's imprisonment continues on unchanged, or is even made straiter, or if it is
even expressly stated that it will never end. All this can rather be the necessary
preliminary to an ultimate liberation.
