27 January. Spindelmiihle. I must be above such mixtures of bad luck and
clumsiness on my own part as the mistake with the sledge, the broken trunk,
the rickety table, the poor light, the impossibility of having quiet in the hotel
during the afternoon, etc. Such superiority cannot be got by not caring, for one
cannot remain indifferent to such things; it can only be got by summoning up
new strength. Here, indeed, surprises await one, this the most despairing
person will allow; experience proves that something can come of nothing, that
the coachman and his horses can crawl out of the tumble-down pig-isty. 124 
My strength crumbling away during the sleigh ride. One cannot make a life
for oneself as a tumbler makes a handstand. 
The strange, mysterious, perhaps dangerous, perhaps saving comfort that
there is in writing: it is a leap out of murderers' row; it is a seeing of what is
really taking place. This occurs by a higher type of observation, a higher, not a
keener type, and the higher it is and the less within reach of the ‘row’, the more
independent it becomes, the more obedient to its own laws of motion, the
more incalculable, the more joyful, the more ascendant its course. 
Despite my having legibly written down my name, despite their having
correctly written to me twice already, they have Joseph K. 125 down in the
directory. Shall I enlighten them, or shall I let them enlighten me?
