sweat from my brow. How would it be if one were to choke to death on oneself?
If the pressure of introspection were to diminish, or close off entirely, the
opening through which one flow's forth into the world. I am not far from it at

Life in the jungle. Jealous of the happiness and inexhaustibility of nature,
whose impelling force (like mine) is yet distress;, though always satisfying all
the demands its antagonist lays upon it. And so effortlessly, so harmoniously. 
In the past, when I had a pain and it passed away, I was happy; now I ammerely relieved, while there is this bitter feeling in me: ‘Only to be well again,
nothing more.' 
Somewhere help is waiting and the beaters are driving me there.
