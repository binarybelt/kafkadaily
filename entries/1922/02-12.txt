12 February. The gesture of rejection with which I was forever met did not
mean: ‘I do not love you,' but: ‘You cannot love me, much as you would like; you
are unhappily in love with your love for me, but your love for me is not in love
with you.' It is consequently incorrect to say that I have known the words, ‘I
love you’; I have known only the expectant stillness that should have been
broken by my ‘I love you’, that is all that I have known, nothing more. 
The fear I have tobogganing, my nervousness in walking on the slippery
snow; a little story I read today revived in me the long unheeded, ever-present
question of whether the cause of my downfall was not insane selfishness, mere
anxiety for self; not, moreover, anxiety for a higher self, but vulgar anxiety for
my well-being; such that it would seem that I have dispatched my own avenger
from myself (a special instance of the-right-hand-not-knowing-what-the-left
hand-does). In the Great Account of my life, it is still reckoned as if my life were
first beginning tomorrow, and in the meantime it is all over with me.
