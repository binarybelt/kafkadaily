12 May. The constant variety of the form it takes, and once, in the midst of it
all, the affecting sight of a momentary abatement in its variations. 
From Pttger Kamanita, from the Vedas: ‘O beloved, even as a man brought
blindfold from the land of the Gandharians and then set free in the desert will
wander east or north or south, for in blindness was he brought there and in
blindness was set free; yet after someone has struck the blindfold from his eyes
and said to him: “Thither dwell the Gandharians, go ye thither,” after having
asked his way from village to village, enlightened and made wise he comes
home to the Gandharians - so too a man who has found a teacher here below
knows: “I shall belong to this earthly coil until I am redeemed, and then I shall
return home.”’ 
In the same place: ‘Such a one, so long as he dwells in the body, is seen by
men and gods; but after his body is fallen to dust, neither men nor gods seehim more. And even nature, the all-seeing, sees him no more: he has blinded
the eye of nature, he has vanished from the sight of the wicked.'
