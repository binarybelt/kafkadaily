8 May. Work with the plough. It digs in deep and yet goes easily along. Or it
just scratches the ground. Or it moves along with the plough-share drawn
uselessly up; with it or without it, It is all the same. The work draws to an end in
the way an unhealed wound might draw together. 
Would you call it a conversation if the other person is silent and, to keep up
the appearance of a conversation, you try to substitute for him, and so imitate
him, and so parody him, and so parody yourself. 
M. was here, won't come again; probably wise and right in this, yet there is
perhaps still a possibility whose locked door we: both are guarding lest it open,
or rather lest we open it, for it will not open of itself. 
Maggid.
