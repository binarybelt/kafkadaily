13 April. Max's grief. Morning in his office. 
Afternoon in front of the Thein Church (Easter Sunday). 
My fear of being disturbed; my insomnia because of this fear. A nightmare
recently because of M.'s letter in my portfolio. 
1. Young little girl, eighteen years old; nose, shape of head, blonde; seen
fleetingly in profile; came out of the church.
