23 January. A feeling of fretfulness again. From what did it arise? From certain
thoughts which are quickly forgotten but leave my fretfulness unforgettably
behind. Sooner than the thoughts themselves I could list the places in which
they occurred to me; one, for example, on the little path that passes the Altneu
Synagogue. Fretful too because of a certain sense of contentment that now
and then drew near me, though timidly enough and sufficiently far off. Fretful
too that my nocturnal resolve remains merely a resolve. Fretful that my life till
now has been merely marking time, has progressed at most in the sense that
decay progresses in a rotten tooth. I have not shown the faintest firmness of
resolve in the conduct of my life. It was as if I, like everyone else, had been
given a point from which to prolong the radius of a circle, and had then, like
everyone else, to describe my perfect circle round this point Instead, I was
forever starting my radius only constantly to be forced at once to break it off.
(Examples: piano, iriolin, languages, Germanics, anti-Zionism, Zionism, Hebrew,
gardening, carpentering, writing, marriage attempts, an apartment of my
own.) The centre of my imaginary circle bristles with the beginnings of radii,
there is no room left for a new attempt; no room means old age and weak
nerves, and never to make another attempt means the end. If I sometimesprolonged the radius a little farther than usual, in the case of my law studies,
say, or engagements, everything was made worse rather than better just
because of this little extra distance. 
Told M. about the night, unsatisfactory. Accept your symptoms, don't
complain of them; immerse yourself in your suffering. 
Heart oppression. 
The second opinion kept in reserve. The third opinion: already forgotten.
