31 January. This would mean that it is on my mother's account that I am alive.
But it cannot be true, for even if I were much more important than I am, I
should still be only an emissary of Life, and, if by nothing else, joined to it by
this commission. 
The Negative alone, however strong it may be, cannot suffice, as in my
unhappiest moments I believe it can. For if I have gone the tiniest step
upwards, won any, be it the most dubious kind of security for myself, I then
stretch out on my step and wait for the Negative, not to climb up to me,
indeed, but to drag me down from it. Hence it is a defensive instinct in me that
won't tolerate my having the slightest degree of lasting ease and smashes the
marriage bed, for example, even before it has been set up.
