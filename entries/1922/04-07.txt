7 April. The two pictures and the two terra-cotla figures in the exhibition. 
Fairy princess (Kubin), naked on a divan, looks out of an open window; the
landscape prominently looming up, has a kind of airiness like that in Schwind's
picture.Nude girl (Bruder) 128 German-Bohemian, her unmatchable grace faithfully
caught by a lover; noble, convincing, seductive. 
Pietsch: Seated peasant girl; luxuriously resting with one leg under her, her
ankle bent. Standing girl, her right arm clasping her body across her belly; left
hand supporting her head under the chin; broad-nosed, simple, and pensive,
unique face. 
Letter by Storm.
