16 June. Quite apart from the insuperable difficulties always presented by
Bliiher's philosophical and visionary power, one is in the difficult position of
easily incurring the suspicion, almost with one's every remark, of wanting
ironically to dismiss the ideas of this book. One is suspect even if, as in my case,

difficulty in reviewing his book has its counterpart in a difficulty that Bliiher,
from his side, cannot surmount. He calls himself an anti-Semite without hatred,
sine ira et studio, and he really is that; yet he easily awakens th6 suspicion,
almost with his every remark, that he is an enemy of the Jews, whether out of
happy hatred or unhappy love. These difficulties confront each other like
stubborn facts of nature, and attention must be called to them lest in reflecting
on this book one stumble over these errors and at the very outset be rendered
incapable of going on.

profound and true. Bliiher draws two conclusions from it, a full and a partial
one –
