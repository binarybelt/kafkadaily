14 February. The power comfort has over me, my powerlessness without it I
know no one in whom both are so great Consequently everything I build is
insubstantial, unstable; the maid who forgets to bring me my warm water in
the morning overturns my world. At the same time I have been under
comfort's constant harassment; it has deprived me not only of the strength to
bear up under anything, but also the strength myself to create comfort; it
creates itself about me of itself, or I achieve it by begging, crying, renouncing
more important things.
