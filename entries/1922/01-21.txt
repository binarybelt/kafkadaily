21 January. As yet, it is not too calm. In the theatre suddenly, when I see
Florestan's prison, the abyss opens. Everything - singers, music, audience,
neighbours, everything - more remote than the abyss. 
No one's task was as difficult, so far as I know. One might say that it is not a
task at all, not even an impossible one, it is not even impossibility itself, it is
nothing, it is not even as much of a child as the hope of a barren woman. Butnevertheless it is the air I breathe, so long as I shall breathe at all. 
I fell asleep past midnight, awoke at five, a remarkable achievement for me,
remarkable good fortune; apart from that I still felt sleepy. My good fortune,
however, proved my misfortune, or now the inevitable thought came: you don't
deserve so much good fortune; all the venging furies flung themselves upon
me, I saw their enraged chieftain widely spread her fingers and threaten me, or
horribly strike cymbals. The excitement of the two hours until seven o'clock not
only devoured what benefit I had got from sleep but made me tremulous and
uneasy all day. 
Without forebears, without marriage, without heirs, with a fierce longing for
forebears, marriage, and heirs. They all of them stretch out their hands to me:
forebears, marriage, and heirs, but too far away for me. 
There is an artificial, miserable substitute for everything, for forebears,
marriage, and heirs. Feverishly you contrive these substitutes, and if the fever
has not already destroyed you, the hopelessness of the substitutes will.
