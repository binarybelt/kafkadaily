30 January. Waiting for pneumonia. Afraid, not so much of the illness, as for
and of my mother, my father, the director, and all the others. Here it would
seem clear that the two worlds do exist and that I am as ignorant in face of the
illness, as detached, as fearful, as, say, in face of a headwaiter. And moreover
the division seems to me to be much too definite, dangerous in its definiteness,
sad, and too tyrannical. Do I live in the other world, then? Dare I say that? 
Someone makes the remark: ‘What do I care about life? It is only on my
family's account that I don't want to die.' But it is just the family that is
representative of life, and so it is on life's account that he wants to stay alive.
Well, so far as my mother is concerned, this would seem to be the case with me
as well, though only lately. But is it not gratitude and compassion that have
brought this change about in me? Yes, gratitude and compassion, because I
see how, with what at her age is inexhaustible strength, she bends every effort
to compensate me for my isolation from life. But gratitude too is life.
