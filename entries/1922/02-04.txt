4 February. In the terrible cold, my changed face, the incompre hensible faces
of the others. 
What M. said, without being able completely to understand the truth of it
(there is a type of sad conceit that is wholly justified), about the joy of merely
talking with people. How can talking delight anyone but me! Too late, probably,
and returning by a queer roundabout way to people.
