10 April. The five guiding principles on the road to hell (in genetic succession): 
1 ‘The worst lies outside the window.' All else is conceded to be angelic either
openly or (more often) by silently ignoring it. 
2 ‘You must possess every girl!' not in Don Juan fashion, but according to the
devil's expression, ‘sexual etiquette’. 
3 ‘This girl you are not permitted to possess!' amd for this very reason cannot.
A heavenly fata Morgana in hell. 
4 ‘All comes back to mere needs.' Since you have needs, resign yourself to the
fact. 
5 ‘Needs are all.' But how could you have all? (Consequently you have not
even needs. 
As a boy I was as innocent of and uninterested in sexual matters (and would
have long remained so, if they had not been forcibly thrust on me) as I am
today in, say, the theory of relativity. Oxdy trifling things (yet even these only
after they were pointedly called to my attention) struck me, for example that it
was just those women on the street who seemed to me most beautiful andbest dressed who were supposed to be bad.
