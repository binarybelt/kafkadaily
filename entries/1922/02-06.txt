6 February. The comfort in hearing that someone had served in Paris,
Brussels, London, Liverpool, had gone up the Amazon on a Brazilian steamer
as far as the Peruvian border, with comparative ease had borne the dreadful
sufferings of the winter campaign of the Seven Communities 126 because he
had been accustomed to hardship since his childhood. The comfort consists
not only in the demonstration that such things are possible, but in the pleasure
one feels when one realizes that with these achievements on the one level,
much at the same time must have necessarily been achieved on the other level,
much must have been wrung from clenched fists. It is possible, then.
