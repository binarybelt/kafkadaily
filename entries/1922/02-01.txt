1 February. Nothing, merely tired. The happiness of the truck driver, whose
every evening is as mine has been today, and even finer. An evening, for
example, stretched out on the stove. A man is purer than in the morning; the
period before falling wearily asleep is really the time when no ghosts haunt
one; they are all dispersed; only as the night advances do they return, in the
morning they have all assembled again, even if one cannot recognize them;and now, in a healthy person. the daily dispersal of them begins anew. 
Looked at with a primitive eye, the real, incontestable truth, a truth marred by
no external circumstance (martyrdom, sacrifice of oneself for the sake of
another), is only physical pain. Strange that the god of pain was not the chief
god of die earliest religions (but first became so in the later ones, perhaps). For
each invalid his household god, for the tubercular the god of suffocation. Kfow
can one bear his approach if one does not partake of him in advance of the
terrible union?
