2 February. Struggle on the road to Tannenstein in the morning struggle
while watching the ski-jumping contest. Happy little B. in all his innocence
somehow shadowed by my ghosts, at least in my eyes, his aimless wandering
glance, his aimless talk. In this connexion it occurs to me - but this is already
forced - that towards evening he wanted to go home with me. 
The ‘struggle' would probably be horrible if I were to learn a trade. 
The Negative having been in all probability greatly strengthened by the
‘struggle’, a decision between insanity and security is imminent. 
The happiness of being with people.
