13 March. This pure feeling I have and my certainty of what has caused it: the
sight of the children, one girl especially (erect carriage, short black hair), and
another (blonde; indefinite features, indefinite smile); the rousing music, the
marching feet. A feeling of one in distress who sees help coming but does not
rejoice at his rescue - nor is he rescued - but rejoices, rather, at the arrival of
fresh young people imbued with confidence and ready to take up the fight;
ignorant, indeed, of what awaits them, but an ignorance that inspires not
hopelessness but admiration and joy in the onlooker and brings tears to his
eyes. Hatred too of him whom the fight is against is mingled in it (but little
Jewish feeling, or so I think).
