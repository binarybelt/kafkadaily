27 July. The attacks. Yesterday a walk with the dog in the evening. Tvrz Sedlec.
The row of cherry trees where the woods end; it gives one almost the same
sense of seclusion as a room. The man and woman returning from the fields.
The girl in the stable door of the dilapidated farmyard seems almost at oddswith her big breasi:s; an innocently attentive animal gaze. The man with
glasses who is pulling the heavy cartload of fodder; elderly, somewhat
hunchbacked, but nevertheless very erect because of his exertions; high boots;
the woman with the sickle, now at his side and now behind him.
