20 January. A little calmer. How needed it was. No sooner is it a little calmer
with me than it is almost too calm. As though I have the true feeling of myself
only when I am unbearably unhappy. That is probably true too. 
Seized by the collar, dragged through the streets, pushed through the door. Inabstract, that is how it is; in reality, there are counterforces, only a trifle less
violent than the forces they oppose - the trifle that keeps life and torment alive.
I the victim of both. 
This ‘too calm’. It is as if the possibility of a calm creative life - and so creativity
in general - were somehow closed to me because of physical reasons, because
of year-long physical torments (confidence! confidence!) - for torment has no
meaning for me beyond itself, is closed off against everything. 
The torso: seen in profile, from the top of the stocking up, knee, thigh, and
hip of a dark woman. 
Longing for the country? It isn't certain. The country calls forth the longing,
the infinite longing. 
M. is right about me: ‘All things are glorious, only not for me, and rightly so.' I
say rightly, and show that I am sanguine at least to this extent Or am I? For it is
not really ‘rightness' that I am thinking of; life, because of its sheer power to
convince, has no room in it for right and wrong. As in the despairing hour of
death you cannot meditate on right and wrong, so you cannot in the
despairing hour of life. It is enough that the arrows fit exactly in the wounds
that they have made. 
On the other hand, there is no trace in me of a general condemnation of my
generation.
