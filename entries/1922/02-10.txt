10 February. Can't sleep; have not the slightest relationship with people other
than what their initiative creates, which then persuades me for the moment, as
does everything they do. 
New attack by G. Attacked right and left as I am by overwhelming forces, it is
as plain as can be that I cannot escape either to the right or to the left - straight
on only, starved beast, lies the road to food that will sustain you, air that you
can breathe, a free life, even if it should take you beyond life. Great, tall
commander-in-chief, leader of multitudes, lead the despairing through the
mountain passes no one else can find beneath the snow. And who is it that
gives you your strength? He who gives you your clear vision. 
The commander-in-chief stood at the window of the ruined hut and looked
outside with wide, unclosing eyes at the column of troops marching by in the
snow under the pale moonlight Now and then it seemed to him that a soldier
out of ranks would halt by the window, press his face against the pane, look at
him for a moment, and then go on. Though always a different soldier, it always
seemed to him to be the same one; a big-boned face with fat cheeks, round
eyes, and coarse sallow skin; each time that the man walked away he would
straighten the straps of his pack, shrug his shoulders, and skip his feet to get
back into step with the mass of troops marching by as always in the
background. The commander-in-chief had no intention of tolerating this game
any longer; he lay in wait for the next soldier, threw open the window in his
face, and seized the man by the front of his coat. ‘Inside with you!' he said, and
made him climb through the window. He pushed the man into a corner, stood
in front of him, and asked: ‘Who are you?' 
‘Nobody,' the soldier said, fearfully. 
One might have expected as much the commander-in-chief said. ‘Why did you
look inside?'‘To see if you were still here.'
