3 February. Almost impossible to sleep; plagued by dreams, as if they were
being scratched on me, on a stubborn material. 
There is a certain failing, a lack in me, that is clear and distinct enough but
difficult to describe: it is a compound of timidity, reserve, talkativeness, and
half-heartedness; by this I intend to characterize something specific, a group of
failings that under a certain aspect constitute one single clearly defined failing
(which has nothing to do with such grave vices as mendacity, vanity, etc.). This
failing keeps me from going mad, but also from making any headway. Because
it keeps me from going mad, I cultivate it; out of fear of madness I sacrificewhatever headway I might make and shall certainly be the loser in the bargain,
for no bargains are possible at this level. Provided that drowsiness does not
intervene and with its nocturnal-diurnal labour break down every obstacle and
clear the road. But in that event I shall be snapped up by madness - for to make
headway one must want to, and I did not.
