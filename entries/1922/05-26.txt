26 May. The severe ‘attacks' during the evening walk (resulting from four tiny
vexations during the day: the dog in the summer resort; Mars's book;
enlistment as a soldier; lending the money through Z.); momentary confusion,
helplessness, hopelessness, unfathomable abyss, nothing but abyss; only when
I turned in at the front door did a thought come to my assistance - during the
entire walk none came to me, apparently because, in my complete
hopelessness, I had made no attempt at all to seek it out, though otherwise its
possibility is always close at hand.
