16 October. Sunday. The misery of having perpetually to begin, the lack of the
illusion that anything is more than, or even as much as, a beginning, the
foolishness of those who do not know this and play football, for example, in
order at last ‘to advance the ball’, one's own foolishness buried within one as if
in a coffin here, hence a coffin that one can transport, open, destroy, exchange. 
Among the young women up in the park. No envy. Enough imagination to
share their happiness, enough judgement to know I am too weak to have such
happiness, foolish enough to think I see to the bottom of my own and their
situation. Not foolish enough; there is a tiny crack there, and wind whistles
through it and spoils the full effect 
Should I greatly yearn to be an athlete, it would probably be the same thing
as my yearning to go to heaven and to be permitted to be as despairing there
as I am here. 
No matter how sorry a constitution I may have, even if - ‘given the same
circumstances' - it be the sorriest in the world (particularly in view of my lack of
energy), I must do the best I can with it (even in my sense of the word) - it is
hollow sophistry to argue liiat there is only one thing to be done with such a
constitution, which must perforce be its best, and that that one thing is todespair.
