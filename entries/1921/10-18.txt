18 October. Eternal childhood. Life calls again, 
It is entirely conceivable that life's splendour forever lies in wait about each
one of us in all its fullness, but veiled from view, deep down, invisible, far off. It
is there, though, not hostile, not reluctant, not deaf. If you summon it by theright word, by its right name, it will come. This is the essence of magic, which
does not create but summons.
