2 November. Vague hope, vague confidence. 
An endless, dreary Sunday afternoon, an afternoon swallowing down whole
years, its every hour a year. By turns walked despairingly down empty streets
and lay quietly on the couch. Occasionally astonished by the leaden,
meaningless clouds almost uninterruptedly drifting by. ‘You are reserved for a
great Monday!' Fine, but Sunday will never end.
