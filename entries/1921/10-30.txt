30 October. In the afternoon to the theatre, Pallenberg. 
The possibilities within me, I won't say to act or write The Miser, but to be the
miser himself. It would need only a sudden determined movement of my
hands, the entire orchestra gazes in fascination at the spot above the
conductor's stand where the baton will rise. 
Feeling of complete helplessness. 
What is it that binds you more intimately to these impenetrable, talking, eye
blinking bodies than to any other thing, the penholder in your hand, for
example? Because you belong to the same species? But you don't belong to the
same species, that's the very reason why you raised this question. 
The impenetrable outline of human bodies is horrible.The wonder, the riddle of my not having perished already, of the silent power
guiding me. It forces one to this absurdity: ‘Left in my own resources, I should
have long ago been lost.' My own resources.
