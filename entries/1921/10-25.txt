25 October. Ehrenstein yesterday. 
My parents were playing cards; I sat apart, a perfect stranger; my father
asked me to take a hand, or at least to look on; I made some sort of excuse.
What is the meaning of these refusals, oft repeated since my childhood? I could
have availed myself of invitations to take part in social, even, to an extent,
public life; everything required of me I should have done, if not well, at least in
middling fashion; even card-playing would probably not have bored me
overmuch - yet I refused. Judging by this, I am wrong when I complain that I
have never been caught up in the current of life, that I never made my escape
from Prague, was never made to learn a sport or trade, and so forth - I should
probably have refused every offer, just as I refused the invitation to play cards. I
allowed only absurd things to claim my attention, my law studies, the job at the
office, and later on such senseless additional occupations as a little gardening,carpentering, and the like; these later occupations are to be looked on as the
actions of a man who throws a needy beggar out the door and then plays the
benefactor by himself by passing alms from his right hand to his left. 
I always refused, out of general weakness, probably, and in particular out of
weakness of will - it was rather a long time before I understood as much. I used
to consider this refusal a good sign (misled by the vague great hopes I
cherished for myself); today only a remnant of this benevolent interpretation
remains.
