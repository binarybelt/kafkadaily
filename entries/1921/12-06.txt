6 December. From a letter: ‘During this dreary winter I warm myself by it.'
Metaphors are one among many things which make me despair of writing.
Writing's lack of independence of the world, its dependence on the maid who
tends the fire, on the cat warming itself by the stove; it is even dependent on
the poor old human being warming himself by the stove. All these are
independent activities ruled by their own laws; only writing is helpless, cannot
live in itself, is a joke and a despair. 
Two children, alone in their house, climbed into a. large trunk; the cover
slammed shut, they could not open it, and suffocated.
