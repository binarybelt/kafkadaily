1 November. Werfel's Goat Song. 
Free command of the world at the expense of its laws. Imposition of the law.
The happiness in obeying the law. 
But the law cannot merely be imposed upon the world, and then everything
left to go on as before except that the new lawgiver be free to do as he pleases.
Such would be not law, but arbitrariness, revolt against law, self-defeat.
