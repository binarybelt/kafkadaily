29 October. A few evenings later I did actually join in, to the extent of keeping
score for my mother. But it begot no intimacy, or whatever trace there was of it
was smothered under weariness, boredom, and regret for the wasted time. It
would always have teen thus. I have seldom, very seldom crossed this
borderland between loneliness and fellowship, I have even been settled there
longer than in loneliness itself. What a fine bustling place was Robinson
Crusoe's island in comparison!
