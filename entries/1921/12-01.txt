1 December. After paying four calls on me, M. left; she goes away tomorrow.Four calmer days in the midst of tormented ones. I feel no sorrow at her
departure, no real sorrow; it is a long way from this unconcern to the point
where her departure would cause me endless sorrow. Sorrow, I confess it, is
not the greatest evil.
