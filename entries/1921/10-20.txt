20 October. In the afternoon Langer, then Max, who read Franzi aloud. 
A short dream, during an agitated, short sleep, in agitation clung to it with a
feeling of boundless happiness. A dream with many ramifications, full of a
thousand connexions that became clear in a flash; but hardly more than the
basic mood remains: My brother had committed a crime, a murder, I think, I
and other people were involved in the crime; punishment, solution, and
salvation approached from afar, loomed up powerfully, many signs indicated
their ineluctable approach; my sister, I think, kept calling out these signs as
they appeared and I kept greeting them with insane exclamations, my insanity
increased as they drew nearer. I thought I should never be able to forget my
fragmentary exclamations, brief sentences merely, because of their
succinctness, and now don't clearly remember a single one. 1 could only have
uttered brief exclamations because of the great effort it cost me to speak - I
had to puff out my cheeks and at the same time contort my mouth as if I had atoothache before I could bring a word out. My feeling of happiness lay in the
fact that I welcomed so freely, with such conviction and such joy, the
punishment that came, a sight that must have moved the gods, and I felt the
gods' emotion almost to the point of tears.
