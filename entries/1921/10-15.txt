15 October [1921]. About a week ago gave M. 119 all the diaries. A little freer?
No. Am I still able to keep a diary? It will in any case be a different kind of diary,
or rather it will hide itself away, there won't be any diary at all; only with the
greatest of effort could I note something down on Hardt, for example, though I
was rather taken with him. It is as if I had already written everything there was
to write about him long ago, or, what is the same thing, as if I were no longer
alive. I could probably write about M., but would not willingly do it, and
moreover it would be aimed too directly at myself; I no longer need to make
myself so minutely conscious of such things, I am not so forgetful as I used to
be in this respect, I am a memory come alive) hence my insomnia.
