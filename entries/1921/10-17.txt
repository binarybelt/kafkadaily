17 October. There may be a purpose lurking behind the fact that I never
learned anything useful and - the two are connected - have allowed myself to
become a physical wreck. I did not want to be distracted, did not want to be
distracted by the pleasures life has to give a useful and healthy man. As if
illness and despair were not just as much of a distraction! 
There are several ways in which I could complete this thought and so reach a
happy conclusion for myself, but don't dare, and don't believe - at least today,
and most of the time as well - that a happy solution exists. 
I do not envy particular married couples, I simply envy all married couples
together; and even when I do envy one couple only, it is the happiness of
married life in general, in all its infinite variety, that I envy - the happiness to be
found in any one marriage, even in the likeliest case, would probably plunge
me into despair. 
I don't believe people exist whose inner plight resembles mine; still, it is
possible for me to imagine such people - but that the secret raven forever flaps
about their heads as it does about mine, even to imagine that is impossible. 
It is astounding how I have systematically destroyed myself in the course of
the years, it was like a slowly widening breach in a dam, a purposeful action.
The spirit that brought it about must now be celebrating triumphs; why doesn't
it let me take part in them? But perhaps it hasn't yet achieved its purpose and
can therefore think of nothing else.
