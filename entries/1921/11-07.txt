7 November. This inescapable duty to observe oneself: if someone else is
observing me, naturally I have to observe myself too; if none observes me, I
have to observe myself all the closer. 
I envy the ease with which all those who fall out with me, or grow indifferent,
or find me a nuisance, can shake me off - provided, probably, that it is not a life
and-death matter for me; once, with F., when it seemed to be a matter of life
and death, it was not easy to shake me off, though of course I was young then,
and strong, with strong desires.
