20 December. Suffered in my thoughts. 
I was startled out of a deep sleep. By the light of a candle I saw a strange man
sitting at a little table in the centre of the room. Broad and heavy, he sat in the
dim light, his unbuttoned winter coat making him appear even broader. 
Don't forget: 
Raabe, while dying, when his wife stroked his forehead: ‘How pleasant.' 
The toothless mouth of the grandfather laughing at his grandchild.Undeniably, there is a certain joy in being able calmly to write down:
‘Suffocation is inconceivably horrible.' Of course it is inconceivable - that is why
I have written nothing down.
