19 October. The essence of the Wandering in the Wilderness. A man who
leads his people along this way with a shred (moie is unthinkable) of
consciousness of what is happening. He is on the track of Canaan all his life; it
is incredible that he should see the land only when on the verge of death. This
dying vision of it can only be intended to illustrate how incomplete a moment is
human life, incomplete because a life like this could last forever and still be
nothing but a moment. Moses fails to enter Canaan not because his life is too
short but because it is a human life. This ending of the Pentateuch bears a
resemblance to the final scene of UEducation sentimentale. 
Anyone who cannot come to terms with his life while he is alive needs one
hand to ward off a little his despair over his fate - he has little success in this -
but with his other hand he can note down what he sees among the ruins, for
he sees different (and more) things than do the others; after all, dead as he is
in his own lifetime, he is the real survivor. This assumes that he does not need
both hands, or more hands than he has, in his struggle against despair.
