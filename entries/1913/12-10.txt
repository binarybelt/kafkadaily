10 December. Discoveries have forced themselves on people. 
The laughing, boyish, sly, revealing face of the chief inspector, a face that I
have never before seen him wear and noticed only today at the moment when
I was reading him a report by the director and happened to glance up from it.
At the same time he also stuck his right hand into his trouser pocket with a
shrug of his shoulder as though he were another person. 
It is never possible to take note of and evaluate all the circumstances that
influence the mood of the moment, are even at work within it, and finally are at
work in the evaluation, hence it is false to say that I felt resolute yesterday, that
I am in despair today. Such differentiations only prove that one desires to
influence oneself, and, as far removed from oneself as possible, hidden behind
prejudices and fantasies, temporarily to create an artificial life, as sometimes
someone in the corner of a tavern, sufficiently concealed behind a small glass
of whisky, entirely alone with himself, entertains himself with nothing but false,
improvable imaginings and dreams. 
Towards midnight a young man in a tight, pale-grey, checked overcoat
sprinkled with snow came down the stairs into the little music hall. He paid hisadmission at the cashier's desk behind which a dozing young lady started up
and looked straight at him with large, black eyes, and then he stopped for a
moment to survey the hall lying three steps below him. 
Almost every evening I go to the railway station; today, because it was
raining, I walked up and down the hall there for half an hour. The boy who kept
eating candy from the slot machine. His reaching into his pocket, out of which
he pulls a pile of change, the careless dropping of a coin into the slot, reading
the labels while he eats, the dropping of some pieces which he picks up from
the dirty floor and sticks right into his mouth. The man, calmly chewing, who is
speaking confidentially at the window with a woman, a relative.
