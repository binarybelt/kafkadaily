12 February. In describing the friend I kept thinking of Steuer. Now when I
happened to meet him about three months after I had written the story, he
told me that he had become engaged about three months ago. 
After I read the story at Weltsch's yesterday, old Mr Weltsch went out and,
when he returned after a short time, praised especially the graphic descriptions
in the story. With his arm extended he said, ‘I see this father before me all the
time looking directly at the empty. chair in which he had been sitting while I
was reading. 
My sister said, ‘It is our house.' I was astonished at how mistaken she was in
the setting and said, ‘In that case, then, Father would have to be living in the
toilet,'
