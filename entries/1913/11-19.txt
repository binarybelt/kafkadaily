19 November. The reading of the diary moves me. Is it because I no longer
have the slightest confidence now? Everything appears to me to be an artificial
construction of the mind. Every mark by someone else, every chance look
throws everything in me over on the other side, even what has been forgotten,
even what is entirely insignificant. I am more uncertain than I ever was, I feel
only the power of life. And I am senselessly empty. I am really like a lost sheepin the night and in the mountains, or like a sheep which is running after this
sheep. To be so lost and not have the strength to regret it. 
I intentionally walk through the streets where there are whores. Walking past
them excites me, the remote but nevertheless existent possibility of going with
one. Is that grossness? But I know no better, and doing this seems basically
innocent to me and causes me almost no regret. I want only the stout, older
ones, with outmoded clothes that have, however, a certain luxuriousness
because of various adornments. One woman probably knows me by now. I met
her this afternoon, she was not yet in her working clothes, her hair was still flat
against her head, she was wearing no hat, a work blouse like a cook's, and was
carrying a bundle of some sort, perhaps to the laundress. No one would have
found anything exciting in her, only me. We looked at each other fleetingly.
Now, in the evening, it had meanwhile grown cold, I saw her, wearing a tight
fitting, yellowish-brown coat, on the other side of the narrow street that
branches off from Zeltnerstrasse, where she has her beat. I looked back at her
twice, she caught the glance too, but then I really ran away from her. 
This uncertainty is surely the result of thinking about F.
