9 December. Weiss's Galeere. Weakening of the effect when the end of the
story begins. The world is conquered and we have watched it with open eyes.
We can therefore quietly turn away and live on.Hatred of active introspection. Explanations of one's soul, such as: Yesterday I
was so, and for this reason; today I am so, and for this reason. It is not true,
not for this reason and not for that reason, and therefore also not so and so. To
put up with oneself calmly, without being precipitate, to live as one must, not
to chase one's tail like a dog. 
I fell asleep in the underbush. A noise awakened me. I found in my hands a
book in which I had previously been reading. I threw it away and sprang up. It
was shortly after midday; in front of the hill on which I stood there lay spread
out a great lowland with villages and ponds and uniformly shaped, tall, reed
like hedges between them. I put my hands on my hips, examined everything
with my eyes, and at the same time listened to the noise.
