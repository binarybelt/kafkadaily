22 October. Too late. The sweetness of sorrow and of love. To be smiled at by
her in the boat. That was most beautiful of all. Always only the desire to die and
the not-yet-yielding; this alone is love. 
Yesterday's observation. The most appropriate situation for me: To listen to a
conversation between two people who are discussing a matter that concerns
them closely while I have only a very remote interest in it which is in addition
completely selfless.
