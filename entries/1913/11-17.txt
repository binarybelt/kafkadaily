17 November. Dream: On a rising way, beginning at the left when seen from
below, there lay, about at the middle of the slope and mostly in the road, a pile
of rubbish or solidly packed clay that had crumbled lower and lower on the
right while on the left it stood up as tall as the palings of a fence. I walked on
the right where the way was almost clear and saw a man on a tricycle coming
towards me from below and apparently riding straight at the obstacle. He wasa man who seemed to have no eyes, at least his eyes looked like holes that had
been effaced. The tricycle was rickety and went along in an uncertain and
shaky fashion, but nevertheless without a sound, with almost exaggerated
quietness and ease. I seized the man at the last moment, held him as though
he were the handle-bars of his vehicle, and guided the latter into the gap
through which I had come. Then he fell towards me, I was as large as a giant
now and yet had an awkward hold on him, besides, the vehicle, as though out
of control, began to move backwards, even if slowly, and pulled me after it. We
went past an open van on which a number of people were standing crowded
together, all dressed in dark clothes, among them a Boy Scout wearing a light
grey hat with the brim turned up. I expected this boy, whom I had already
recognized at some distance, to help me, but he turned away and squeezed
himself in among the people. Then, behind this open van - the tricycle kept
rolling on and I, bent low, with legs astraddle, had to follow -there came
towards me someone who brought me help, but whom I cannot remember. I
only know that he was a trustworthy person who is now concealing himself as
though behind a black cloth curtain and whose concealment I should respect.
