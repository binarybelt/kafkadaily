19 July. Out of a house there stepped four armed men. Each held a halberd
upright before him. Now and then one of them looked to the rear to see
whether he was coming on whose account they were standing here. It was
early in the morning, the street was entirely empty. 
So what do you want? Come! - We do not want to. Leave us! 
All the inner effort just for this! That is why the music from the coffee-house
rings so in one's ear. The stone's throw about which Elsa B. spoke becomes
visible. 
[A woman is sitting at the distaff. A man pushes the door open with a sword which
is sheathed in its scabbard (he is holding it loosely in his hand).] 
MAN: He was here! 
WOMAN: Who? What do you want?MAN: The horse thief. He is hiding here. Don't lie! [He brandishes the sword.] 
WOMAN [raising the distaff to protect herself]: No one was here. Let me alone!
