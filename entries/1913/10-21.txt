21 October. Lost day. Visit to the Ringhoffer factory, Ehrenfels's seminar, at
Weltsch's, dinner, walk, now here at ten o'clock. I keep thinking of the black
beetle, 61 but will not write. 
In the small harbour of a fishing village a barque was being fitted out for a
voyage. A young man in wide sailor-trousers was supervising the work. Two old
sailors were carrying sacks and chests to a gangplank where a tall man, his legs
spread wide, took everything and handed it over into hands that stretched
towards him from the dark interior of the barque. On the large, square-hewn
stones enclosing a corner of the dock, half reclining, sat five men, they blew the
smoke of their pipes in all directions. From time to time the man in the wide
sailor-trousers went up to them, made a little speech, and slapped them on the
knees. Usually a wine jug was brought out from behind a stone in whose shade
it was kept, and a glass of opaque red wine passed from man to man.
