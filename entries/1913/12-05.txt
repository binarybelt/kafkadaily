5 December. How furious I am with my mother! I need only begin to talk to
her and I am irritated, almost scream. 
O. is really suffering and I do not believe that she is suffering, that she is
capable of suffering, do not believe it in the face of my knowing better, do not
believe it in order not to have to stand by her, which I could not do, for she
irritates me too. 
Externally I see only little details of F., at least sometimes, so few they may be
counted. By these her picture is made clear, pure, original, distinct, and lofty, all
at once.
