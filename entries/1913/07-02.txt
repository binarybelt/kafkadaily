2 July. Wept over the report of the trial of twenty-three-year-old Marie
Abraham who, because of poverty and hunger, strangled her not quite nine
month-old child, Barbara, with a man's tie that she used as a garter. Very
routine story.The fire with which, in the bathroom, I described to my sister a funny motion
picture. Why can I never do that in the presence of strangers? 
I would never have married a girl with whom I had lived in the same city for a
year.
