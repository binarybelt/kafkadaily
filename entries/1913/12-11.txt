11 December. In Toynbee Hall read the beginning of Michael Kohlhaas.
Complete and utter fiasco. Badly chosen, badly presented, finally swam
senselessly around in the text. Model audience. Very small boys in the front
row. One of them tries to overcome his innocent boredom by carefully
throwing his cap on the floor and then carefully picking it up, and then again,
over and over. Since he is too small to accomplish this from his seat, he has to
keep sliding off the chair a little. Read wildly and badly and carelessly and
unintelligibly. And in the afternoon I was already trembling with eagerness to
read, could hardly keep my mouth shut. 
No push is really needed, only a withdrawal of the last force placed at my
disposal, and I fall into a despair that rips me to pieces. Today, when I imagined
that I would certainly be calm during the lecture, I asked myself what sort of
calm this would be, on what it would be based, and I could only say that it
would merely be a calm for its own sake, an incomprehensible grace, nothing
else.
