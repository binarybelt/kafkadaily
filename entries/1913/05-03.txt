3 May. The terrible uncertainty of my inner existence. 
How I unbutton my vest to show Mr B. my rash. How I beckon him into
another room. 
The leper and his wife. The way her behind - she is lying in bed on her belly -
keeps rising up with all its ulcers again and again although a guest is present.
The way her husband keeps shouting at her to keep covered. 
The husband has been struck from behind by a stake — no one knows where
it came from - knocked down and pierced. Lying on the ground with his head
raised and his arms stretched out, he laments. Later he is able to stand up
unsteadily for a moment. He can talk about nothing except how he was struck,
and points to the approximate direction from which in his opinion the stake
came. This talk, always the same, is by now tiresome to the wife, particularly
since the man is always pointing in another direction.
