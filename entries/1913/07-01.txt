1 July. The wish for an unthinking, reckless solitude. To be face to face only
with myself. Perhaps I shall have it in Riva. 
Day before yesterday with Weiss, 57 author of Die Galeere. Jewish physician,
Jew of the kind that is closest to the type of the Western European Jew and to
whom one therefore immediately feels close. The tremendous advantage of
Christians who always have and enjoy such feelings of closeness in general
intercourse, for instance a Christian Czech among Christian Czechs. 
The honeymoon couple that came out of the Hotel de Saxe. In the afternoon.
Dropping the card in the mailbox. Wrinkled clothing, lazy pace, dreary, tepid
afternoon. Faces scarcely individualized at first sight. 
The picture of the celebration of the Romanov tercentenary in Yaroslavl on
the Volga. The Tsar, the annoyed princesses standing in the sun, only one -
delicate, elderly, indolent, leaning on her parasol -is looking straight ahead. The
heir to the throne on the arm of the huge, bareheaded Cossack. In another
picture, men who had long since passed by are saluting in the distance. 
The millionaire in the motion picture Slaves of Gold. Mustn't forget him. The
calmness, the slow movement, conscious of its goal, a faster step when
necessary, a shrug of the shoulder. Rich, spoiled, lulled to sleep, but how he
springs up like a servant and searches the room into which he was locked in
the forest tavern.
