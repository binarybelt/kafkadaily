14 August. The opposite has happened. There were three letters. The last
letter I could not resist. I love her as far as I am capable of it, but the love lies
buried to the point of suffocation under fear and self-reproaches. 
Conclusion for my case from ‘The Judgement’. I am indirectly in her debt for
the story. But Georg goes to pieces because of his fiancee. 
Coitus as punishment for the happiness of being together. Live as ascetically
as possible, more ascetically than a bachelor, that is the only possible way for
me to endure marriage. But she? 
And despite all this, if we, I and F., had equal rights, if we had the same
prospects and possibilities, I would not marry. But this blind alley into which I
have slowly pushed her life makes it an unavoidable duty for me, although its
consequences are by no means unpredictable. Some secret law of human
relationship is at work here. 
I had great difficulty writing the letter to her parents, especially because a
first draft, written under particularly unfavourable circumstances, for a long
time resisted every change. Today, nevertheless, I have just about succeeded,
at least there is no untruth in it, and after all it is still something that parentscan read and understand.
