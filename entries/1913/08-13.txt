13 August. Perhaps everything is now ended and the letter I wrote yesterday
was the last one. That would certainly be the best. What I shall suffer, what she
will suffer - that cannot be compared with the common suffering that would
result. I shall gradually pull myself together, she will marry, that is the only way
out among the living. We cannot beat a path into the rock for the two of us, it is
enough that we wept and tortured ourselves for a year. She will realize this
from my last letters. If not, then I will certainly marry her, for I am too weak to
resist her opinion about our common fortune and am unable not to carry out,
as far as I can, something she considers possible. 
Yesterday evening on the Belvedere under the stars.
