21 June. The anxiety I suffer from all sides. The examination by the doctor, the
way he presses forward against me, I virtually empty myself out and he makes
his empty speeches into me, despised and unrefuted. 
The tremendous world I have in my head. But how free myself and free it
without being torn to pieces. And a thousand times rather be torn to pieces
than retain it in me or bury it. That, indeed, is why I am here, that is quite clear
to me. 
On a cold spring morning about five o'clock a tall man in a cloak that reached
to his feet knocked with his fist against the door of a small hut which stood in abare, hilly region. The moon was still white and bright in the sky. After each
blow of his fist he listened, within the hut there was silence.
