30 August. Where am I to find salvation? How many untruths I no longer even
knew about will be brought to the surface. If they are going to pervade our
marriage as they pervaded the good-bye, then I have certainly done the right
thing. In me, by myself, without human relationship, there are no visible lies.
The limited circle is pure.
