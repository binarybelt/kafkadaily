15 December. Letters to Dr Weiss and Uncle Alfred. No telegram came. 
Read Wit Jungen von 1870-1. Again read with suppressed sobs of the victories
and scenes of enthusiasm. To be a father and speak calmly to one's son. For
this, however, one shouldn't have a little toy hammer in place of a heart. 
‘Have you written to your uncle yet?' my mother asked me, as I had
maliciously been expecting for some time. She had long been watching me
with concern, for various reasons did not dare in the first place to ask me, and
in the second place to ask me in front of my father, and at last, in her concern
when she saw that I was about to leave, asked me nevertheless. When I passed
behind her chair she looked up from her cards, turned her face to me with a
long-vanished, tender motion somehow revived for the moment, and asked
me, looking up only furtively, smiling shyly, and already humbled in the askingof the question, before any answer had been received.
