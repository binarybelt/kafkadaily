4 May. Always the image of a pork butcher's broad knife that quickly and with
mechanical regularity chops into me from the sideand cuts off very thin slices
which fly off almost like shavings because of the speed of the action.Early one morning, the streets were still empty up and down their length and
breadth, a man, he was in his bare feet and wore only a nightshirt and
trousers, opened the door of a large tenement on the main street. He seized
the two sections of the door and took a deep breath. ‘Misery, oh, damned
misery,' he said and looked, apparently calmly, first along the street and then
at some houses. 
Despair from this direction too. Nowhere a welcome. 
1. Digestion. 2. Neurasthenia. 3. Rash. 4. Inner insecurity.
