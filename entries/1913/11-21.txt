21 November. Dream: The French cabinet, four men, is sitting around a table.
A conference is taking place. I remember the man sitting on the long right side
of the table, with his face flattened out in profile, yellowish-coloured skin, his
very straight nose jutting far forward (jutting so far forward because of the
flatness of his face) and an oily, black, heavy moustache arching over his
mouth. 
Miserable observation which again is certainly the result of something
artificially constructed whose lower end is swinging in emptiness somewhere:When I picked up the inkwell from the desk to carry it into the living-room I felt
a sort of firmness in me, just as, for instance, the corner of a tall building
appears in the mist and at once disappears again. I did not feel lost, something
waited in me that was independent of people, even of F. What would happen if
I were to run away, as one sometimes runs through the fields? 
These predictions, this imitating of models, this fear of something definite, is
ridiculous. These are constructions that even in the imagination, where they
are alone sovereign, only approach the living surface but then are always
suddenly driven under. Who has the magic hand to thrust into the machinery
without its being torn to pieces and scattered by a thousand knives? 
I am on the hunt for constructions. I come into a room and find them whitely
merging in a corner.
