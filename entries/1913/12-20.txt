20 December. No letter.The effect of a peaceful face, calm speech, especially when exercised by a
strange person one hasn't seen through yet. The voice of God out of a human
mouth. 
An old man walked through the streets in the mist one winter evening. It was
icy cold. The streets were empty. No one passed near him, only now and then
he saw in the distance, half concealed by the mist, a tall policeman or a woman
in furs or shawls. Nothing troubled him, he merely intended to visit a friend at
whose house he had not been for a long time and who had just now sent a
servant girl to ask him to come. 
It was long past midnight when there came a soft knock on the door of the
room of the merchant Messner. It wasn't necessary to wake him, he fell asleep
only towards morning, and until that time he used to lie awake in bed on his
belly, his face pressed into the pillow, his arms extended, and his hands clasped
over his head. He had heard the knocking immediately. ‘Who is it?' he asked. An
indistinct murmur, softer than the knocking, replied. ‘The door is open,' he said,
and turned on the electric light. A small, delicate woman in a large grey shawl
entered.
