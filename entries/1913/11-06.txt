6 November. Whence the sudden confidence? If it would only remain! If I
could go in and out of every door in this way, a passably erect person. Only I
don't know whether I want that. 
We didn't want to tell our parents anything about it, but every evening after
nine o'clock we met, I and two cousins, near the cemetery fence at a place
where a little rise in the ground provided a good view. 
The iron fence of the cemetery leaves a large, grass-grown place free on the
left.
