23 July. With Felix in Rostock. The bursting sexuality of the women. Their
natural impurity. The flirtation, senseless for me, with little Lena. The sight of a
stout woman hunched up in a basket chair, one foot curiously pushed
backwards, who was sewing something and talking to an old woman, probably
an old spinster, whose teeth appeared unusually large on one side of her
mouth. The full-bloodedness and wisdom of the pregnant woman. Her behind
almost faceted by evenly divided planes. The life on the small terrace. How I
coldly took the little girl on my lap, not at all unhappy about the coolness. 
How childishly a tinker, seen through the open door of his shop, sits at his
work and keeps striking with his hammer.

night' is regarded as the creator of the world.
