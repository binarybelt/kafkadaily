20 November. Was at the cinema. Lolotte. The good minister. The little bicycle.
The reconciliation of the parents. Was tremendously entertained. Before it, a
sad film, The Accident on the Dock, after it, the gay Alone at Last Am entirely
empty and insensible, the passing tram has more living feeling.
