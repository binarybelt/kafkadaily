10 November. I haven't yet written down the decisive thing, I am still going in
two directions. The work awaiting me is enormous. 
Dreamed of the battle of the Tagliamento. A plain, the river wasn't really
there, a crowd of excited onlookers ready to run forwards or backwards as the
situation changed. In front of us a plateau whose plainly visible edge was
alternately bare and overgrown with tall bushes. Upon the plateau and beyond
Austrians were fighting. Everyone was tense; what would be the outcome? By
way of diversion you could from time to time look at isolated clumps on the
dark slope, from behind which one or two Italians were firing. But that had no
importance, though we did take a few steps backwards in flight. Then the
plateau again: Austrians ran along the bare edge, pulled up abruptly behind
the bushes, ran again. Things were apparently going badly, and moreover it
was incomprehensible how they could ever go well; how could one merely
human being ever conquer other human beings who were imbued with a will
to defend themselves? Great despair, there will have to be a general retreat. A
Prussian major appeared who had been watching the battle with us all the
while; but when he calmly stepped forward into the suddenly deserted terrain,
he seemed a new apparition. He put two fingers of each hand into his mouth
and whisded the way one whistles to a dog, though affectionately. This was a
signal to his detachment, which had been waiting close by and now marched
forward. They were Prussian Guards, silent young men, not many, perhaps only
a company, all seemed to be officers, at least they carried long sabres and their
uniforms were dark. When they marched by us, with short steps, slowly, in
close order, now and then Hooking at us, the matter-of-factness of their death
march was at once stirring, solemn, and a promise of victory. With a feeling of
relief at the intercession of these men, I woke up.
