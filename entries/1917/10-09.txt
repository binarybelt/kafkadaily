9 October. At the peasant Luftner's. The great hail. All of it quite theatrical. His
nervous hee-hee and ha-ha, banged on the table, raised his arms, shrugged his
shoulders and lifted his beer glass like one of Wallenstein's men. His wife
beside him, an old woman whom he married ten years ago when he was her
hired hand. Is a passionate hunter, neglects the farm. Two huge horses in the
stable, Homeric figures in a fleeting ray of sunshine coming through the stable
windows.
