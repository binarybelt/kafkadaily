6 April. Today, in the tiny harbour where save for fishing boats only two ocean
going passenger steamers used to call, a strange boat lay at anchor. A clumsy
old craft, rather low and very broad, filthy, as if bilge water had been poured
over it, it still seemed to be dripping down the yellowish sides; the masts
disproportionately tall, the upper third of the mainmast split; wrinkled, coarse,
yellowish-brown sails stretched anyhow between the yards, patched, too weak
to stand against die slightest gust of wind. 
I gazed in astonishment at it for a time, waited for someone to show himself
on deck; no one appeared, A workman sat down beside me on the harbour
wall. ‘Whose ship is that?' I asked; ‘this is the first time I've seen it.' 
‘It puts in every two or three years,' the man said, ‘and belongs to the Hunter
Gracchus.'
