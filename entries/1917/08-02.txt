2 August. Usually the one whom you are looking for lives next door. This isn't
easy to explain, you must simply accept it as a fact. It is so deeply founded that
there is nothing you can do about it, even if you should make an effort to. The
reason is that you know nothing of this neighbour you are looking for. That is,
you know neither that you are looking for him nor that he lives next door, in
which case he very certainly lives next door. You may of course know this as a
general fact in your experience; only such knowledge doesn't matter in the
least, even if you expressly keep it forever in mind. I'll tell you of one such case
– 
Pascal arranges everything very tidily before God makes his appearance, butthere must be a deeper, uneasier scepticism than that of a man cutting himself
to bits with - indeed - wonderful knives, but still, with the calm of a butcher.
Whence this calm? this confidence with which the knife is wielded? Is God a
theatrical triumphal chariot that (granted the toil and despair of the stage
hands) is hauled on to the stage from afar by ropes?
