A: I am not satisfied with you. 
B: I won't ask why. I know. 
A: And? 
I am so powerless. I can change nothing. Shrug my shoulders and screw
up my mouth, that's all; I can't do more. 
A: I'll take you to my Master. Will you go? 
B: I feel ashamed. How will he receive me? Go straight to the Master! It's
not right. 
A: Let me bear the responsibility. I'm taking you. Come. [They go along a
corridor. A knocks on a door. A voice calk outy ‘Come in.’ B wants to run away,
but A catches hold of him and they enter.] 
C: Who is the Master?

B: I've found none. 
A: And you're the one who knows the neighbourhood best of all. 
B: Yes.
