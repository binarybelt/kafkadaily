30 July. Miss K. Coquetry that ill suits the kind of person she is. She spreads,
points, pouts her lips as if her fingers were invisibly shaping them. Makes
sudden, probably nervous, though controlled movements which always take
one by surprise - the way she arranges her skirt over her knees, for instance, or
changes her seat. Her conversation contains a minimum of words and ideas, is
unassisted by other people, is chiefly produced by turns of her head,
gesticulations, various pauses, lively glances; if necessary, by clenching her
little fists. 
He disengaged himself from their midst. Mist blew about him. A round
clearing in the woods. The phoenix in the underbrush. A hand continually
making the sign of the cross on an invisible face. A cool, perpetual rain, a
changing song, as if from a heaving breast. 
A useless person. A friend? If I attempt to summon to mind what those
attributes are which he possesses, what remains, even after the most
charitable verdict, is only his voice, somewhat deeper than mine. If I cry out,
‘Saved!' - I mean if I were Robinson Crusoe and cried out, ‘Saved!' - he would
echo it in his deeper voice. If I were Korah and cried out, ‘Lost!' he would
promptly be there with his deeper voice to echo it. One eventually grows weary
of perpetually leading this bass fiddler around with one. He himself by no
means does this cheerfully, he echoes me only because he must and can do
nothing else. Occasionally, during a holiday, when for once I have time to turn
my attention to such personal matters, I consult with him, in the garden
perhaps, as to how I might get rid of him.
