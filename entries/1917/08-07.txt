 A: You're always hanging around the door here. Now what do you want? 
B: Nothing, thank you. 
A: Really! Nothing? Besides, I know you. 
B: You must be mistaken. 
A: No, no. You are B and went to school here twenty years ago. Yes or no? 
B: All right, yes. I didn't dare introduce myself. 
A: You do seem to have grown timid with the years. You weren't then. 
B: Yes, then I wasn't. I repent me of everything as if I had done it this very
hour. 
A: YOU see, everything is paid for in this life. B: Alas! A: I told you so.B: YOU told me so. But it isn't so. Things aren't paid for directly. What does
my employer care if I chattered in school. That was no obstacle to my
career, no. 
The explorer felt too tired to give commands or to do anything. He merely
took a handkerchief from his pocket, gestured as if he were dipping it in the
distant bucket, pressed it to his brow, and lay down beside the pit. He was
found in this position by the two men the Commandant had sent out to fetch
him. He jumped up when ‘they spoke to him as if revived. With his hand on his
heart he said,' I am a cur if I allow that to happen.' But then he took his own
words literally and began to run around on all fours. From time to time,
however, he leaped erect, shook the fit off, so to speak, threw his arms around
the neck of one of the men, and tearfully exclaimed, ‘Why does all this happen
tome!' and then hurried to his post.
