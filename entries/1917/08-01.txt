1 August. Dr O.'s stories at the swimming-pool of old Prague. The wild
speeches Friederich Adler 110 made against the rich during his student days,
which everyone laughed at so; later he made a wealthy match and spoke no
more - When Dr O. was a little boy and came from Amschelberg to attend the
Gymnasium at Prague, he lived with a Jewish scholar whose wife was a
saleswoman in a second-hand clothing store. Meals were brought in from a
tavern. At half past five every day, O. was awakened for prayers - He provided
for the education of all his younger brothers and sisters; it caused him a great
deal of labour but gave him confidence and satisfaction. A certain Dr A., who
later became a treasury official and has long been retired (a great egoist). once
advised him at that time to go away, hide, simply run away from his family, for
otherwise they would be the ruin of him. 
I tighten the reins.
