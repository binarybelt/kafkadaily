15 October. On the highway to Oberklee in the evening; went because the
housekeeper and two Hungarian soldiers were sitting in the kitchen. 
The view from Ottla's window in the twilight, yonder a house and immediately
behind it the open fields. 
K. and his wife in their fields on the slope opposite my window.
