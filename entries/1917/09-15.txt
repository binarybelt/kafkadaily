15 September. 113 You have the chance, as far as it is at all possible, to make a
new beginning. Don't throw it away. If you insist on digging deep into yourself,
you won't be able to avoid the muck that will well up. But don't wallow in it. If
the infection in your lungs is only a symbol, as you say, a symbol of the
infection whose inflammation is called F. and whose depth is its deep
justification; if this is so then the medical advice (light, air, sun, rest) is also a
symbol. Lay hold of this symbol. 
O wonderful moment, masterful version, garden gone to seed. You turn the
corner as you leave the house and the goddess of luck rushes towards you
down the garden path. 
Majestic presence, prince of the realm.The village square abandoned to the night. The wisdom of the children. The
primacy of the animals. The women. Cows moving across the square in the
most matter-of-fact way.
