From a letter to F., perhaps the last (1 October): 
If I closely examine what is my ultimate aim, it turns out that I am not really
striving to be good and to fulfil the demands of a Supreme Judgement, but
rather very much the contrary: I strive to know the whole human and animal
community, to recognize their basic predilections, desires, moral ideals, to
reduce these to simple rules and as quickly as possible trim my behaviour to
these rules in order that I may find favour in the whole world's eyes; and,
indeed (this is the inconsistency), so much favour that in the end I could openly
perpetrate the iniquities within me without alienating the universal love in
which I am held - the only sinner who won't be roasted. To sum up, then, my
sole concern is the human tribunal, which I wish to deceive, moreover, though
without practising any actual deception.
