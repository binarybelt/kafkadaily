31 July. Sit in a train, forget the fact, and live as if you were at home; but
suddenly recollect where you are, feel the onward-rushing power of the train,change into a traveller, take a cap out of your bag, meet your fellow travellers
with a more sovereign freedom, with more insistence, let yourself be carried
towards your destination by no effort of your own, enjoy it like a child, become
a darling of the women, feel the perpetual attraction of the window, always
have at least one hand extended on the window sill. Same situation, more
precisely stated: Forget that you forgot, change in an instant into a child
travelling by itself on an express train around whom the speeding, trembling
car materializes in its every fascinating detail as if out of a magician's hand.
