10 August I was standing with my father in the lobby of a building; outside it
was raining very hard. A man was about to hurry into the lobby from the street
when he noticed my father. That made him stop. ‘Georg,' he said slowly, as
though he had gradually to bring old memories to the surface, and, holding
out his hand, approached my father from the side. 
‘No, let me alone! No, let me alone!' I shouted without pause all the way along
the streets, and again and again she laid hold of me, again and again the
clawed hands of the siren struck at my breast from the side or across my
shoulder.
