16 October. Among the four conditions that the Hussites proposed to theCatholics as basis for an agreement, there was one that made all mortal sins -
by which they meant ‘gluttony, drunkenness, unchastity, lying, perjury, usury,
fee-taking for confessions, and mass' - punishable by death. One faction even
wanted to grant each and every individual the right to exact the death penalty
on the spot whenever he saw anyone besmirching himself with one of these
sins. 
Is it possible that reason and desire first disclose the bare outlines of the
future to me, and that I actually move step by step into this same future only
under their tugs and blows? 
We are permitted to crack that whip, the will, over us with our own hand.
