4 July. I awoke to find myself imprisoned in a fenced enclosure which allowed
no room for more than a step in either direction. Sheep are folded into pens of
this kind, though theirs are not so narrow. The direct rays of the sun beat down
on me; to shield my head I pressed it against my breast and squatted down
with hunched back. 
What are you? I am miserable. I have two little boards screwed against my
temples.
