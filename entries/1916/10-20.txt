hindquarters a stable boy was rubbing down. ‘I haven't said the white-haired
elder man, squinting one eye somewhat as he gently gnawed his lower lip, ‘I
haven't seen Atro for a week now, one's memory for horses is an uncertain
thing no matter how much practice one has had. I miss qualities in Atro, now,
that I distinctly remember him to have had. It is the total impression I speak of
- the details, I am sure, are correct, though I do notice a fiabbiness of his
muscles here and there. Look here and here.' His lowered head moved from
side to side in scrutiny and his hands groped in the air.
