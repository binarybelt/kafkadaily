19 June. Forget everything. Open the windows. Clear the room. The wind
blows through it. You see only its emptiness, you search in every corner and
don't find yourself. 
With Ottla. Called for her at the English teacher's. Home by way of the quay,
the stone bridge, a short stretch of the Kleinseite, the new bridge. Was excited
by the statues of saints on the Karlsbriicke. The remarkable light of the
summer evening together with the nocturnal emptiness of the bridge.

The calm of Adam and Eve.

My spirit shall not always strive with man. 
Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord. 
And Enoch walked with God, and he was not; for God took him.
