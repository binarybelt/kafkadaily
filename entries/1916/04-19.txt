19 April. He attempted to open the door to the corridor, but it resisted. He
looked up and down but could not discover what the obstacle was. Nor was the
door locked; the key in the lock on the inside, if anyone had tried to lock it from
the outside the key would have been pushed out. And after all, who could have
locked it? He pushed against the door with his knee, the frosted glass rang, but
the door stuck fast. How odd. 
He went back into the room, stepped out on the balcony, and looked down
into the street. But before he had given a thought to the usual afternoon
activity below, he again returned to the door and once more attempted to open
it. This time, however, it proved more than an attempt, the door immediately
opened, hardly any pressure was needed, the draught blowing in from the
balcony made it fly right open; he gained entry into the corridor as effortlessly
as a child who is playfully allowed to touch the latch at the same time actually
that an older person presses it down. 
I shall have three weeks to myself. Do you call that inhuman treatment? 
A short time ago this dream: We were living on the Graben near the Cafe
Continental. A regiment turned in from Herrengasse on its way to the railway
station. My father: ‘That's something to look at as long as one can’; he swings
himself up on the sill (in Felix's brown bathrobe, the figure in the dream was a
mixture of the two) and with outstretched arms sprawls outside on the broad,
sharply sloping window ledge. I catch hold of him by the two little loops
through which the cord of his bathrobe passes. Maliciously, he leans even
farther out, I exert all my strength to hold him. I think how good it would be if I
could fasten my feet by ropes to something solid so that my father could not
pull me out. But to do that I should have to let go of my father, at least for a
short time, and that's impossible. Sleep - my sleep, especially - cannot
withstand all this tension and I wake up.
