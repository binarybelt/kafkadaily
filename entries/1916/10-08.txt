8 October. Forster: Wants the social relations that exist in school life to be
made a subject of instruction. 
The bringing up of children as a conspiracy on the part of adults. We lure
them from their unconstrained rompings into our narrow dwelling by
pretences in which we perhaps believe, but not in the sense we pretend. (Who
would not like to be a nobleman? Shut the door.) 
The incompensable value of giving free rein to one's vices consists in this,
that they rise into view in all their strength and size, even if, in the excitement
of indulgence, one catches only a faint glimpse of them. One doesn't learn to
be a sailor by exercising in a puddle, though too much training in a puddle can
probably render one unfit to be a sailor.
