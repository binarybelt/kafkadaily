3 July. First day in Marienbad with F. Door to door, keys on either side. 
Three houses adjoined each other, forming a little yard. There were also two
workshops under sheds in this yard, and in one corner stood a high pile of
small boxes. One very stormy night - the wind drove the rain in sheets over the
lowest of the houses into the yard - a student still sitting over his books in an
attic room heard a loud groan in the yard. He jumped up and listened, but
there was silence, unbroken silence. ‘I was probably mistaken,' the student told
himself, and resumed his reading. 
‘Not mistaken,' this, after a moment, was what the letters in his book seemed
to spell out. 
‘Mistaken,' he repeated, and moved his index finger along the lines to calm
their restlessness.
