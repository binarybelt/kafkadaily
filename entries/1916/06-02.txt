2 June. What a muddle I've been in with girls, in spite of all my headaches,
insomnia, grey hair, despair. Let me count them: there have been at least six
since the summer. I can't resist, my tongue is fairly torn from my mouth if I
don't give in and admire anyone who is admirable and love her until admiration
is exhausted. With all six my guilt is almost wholly inward, though one of the six
did complain of me to someone. 
From Das Werden des Gottesglaubens by N. Soderblom, Archbishop of Upsala;
quite scientific, without his being personally or religiously involved. 
The primordial divinity of the Mesai: how he lowered the first cattle down
from heaven on a leather strap to the first kraal. 
The primordial divinity of some Australian tribes: he came out of the west in
the guise of a powerful medicine man, made men, animals, trees, rivers,
mountains, instituted the sacred ceremonies, and determined from which clan
a member of another clan was to take his wife. His task completed, he went
away. The medicine men could climb up to him on a tree or a rope and receive
their power from him.Other tribes: during their creative wanderings from place to place they also
performed the sacred dances and rites for the first time. 
Others: in primordial times men themselves created their totem animals by
their ceremonies. The sacred rites thus of themselves begot the object of their
veneration. 
The Bimbiga near the coast tell of two men who in primordial times created
springs, forests, and ceremonies in the course of their wanderings.
