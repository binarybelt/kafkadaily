20 July. A small bird flew out of a near-by chimney, perched on its edge,
looked about, soared, and flew away. It is no ordinary bird that flies out of a
chimney. From a window on the first floor a girl looked up at the sky, saw the
bird's upward flight, and cried: ‘There it goes, quick, there it goes!' and two
children at once crowded to her side to see the bird. 
Have mercy on me, I am sinful in every nook and cranny of my being. But my
gifts were not entirely contemptible; I had some small talents, squandered
them, unadvised creature that I was, am now near my end just at a time when
outwardly everything might at last turn out well for me. Don't thrust me in
among the lost. I know it is my ridiculous love of self that speaks here,
ridiculous whether looked at from a distance or close at hand; but, as I am
alive, I also have life's love of self, and if life is not ridiculous its necessary
manifestations can't be either - Poor dialectic! 
If I am condemned, then I am not only, condemned to die, but also
condemned to struggle till I die. 
Sunday morning, shortly before I left, you seemed to want to help me. I
hoped. Until today a vain hope. 
And no matter what my complaint, it is without conviction, even without real
suffering; like the anchor of a lost ship, it swings far above the bottom in which
it could catch hold. 
Let me only have rest at night - childish complaint.
