21 July. They called. The weather was fine. We stood up, a mixed lot of people,
and assembled in front of the house. The street was silent as it always is in the
early morning. A baker's boy put down his basket and watched us. All of us
came running down the stairs at each other's heels, all the people living on the
six floors were mingled indiscrim inately together; I myself helped the
merchant on the first floor put on the overcoat he had until then been
dragging behind him. This merchant was our leader; that was only right, he
had more experience of the world than any of us. First he arranged us in an
orderly group, admonished the most restive of us to be quiet, took away the
hat the bank clerk insisted on swinging and threw it across the street; each
child's hand was taken by an adult.
