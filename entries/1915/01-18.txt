18 January. In the factory until half past six; as usual, worked, read, dictated,
listened, wrote without result. The same meaningless satisfaction after it.
Headache, slept badly. Incapable of sustained, concentrated work. Also have
been in the open air too litde. In spite of that began a new story; I was afraid I
should spoil the old ones. Four or five stories now stand on their hindlegs in
front of me like the horses in front of Schumann, the circus ringmaster, at the
beginning of the performance.
