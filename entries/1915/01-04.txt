4 January. Great desire to begin another story; didn't yield to it. It is all
pointless. If I can't pursue the stories through the nights, they break away and
disappear, as with ‘The Assistant Attorney' now. And tomorrow I go to the
factory, shall perhaps have to go there every afternoon after P. joins up. With
that, everything is at an end. The thought of the factory is my perpetual Day of
Atonement.
