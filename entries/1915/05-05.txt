5 May. Nothing, dull slight headache. Chotek Park in the afternoon, read
Strindberg, who sustains me. 
The long-legged, black-eyed, yellow-skinned, childlike girl, merry, pert, and
lively. Saw a friend who was carrying her hat in her hand. ‘Do you have two
heads?' Her friend immediately understood the joke, in itself a rather feeble
one, but alive with the voice and all of the little personality that had been put
into it. Laughing, she repeated it to another friend whom she met a few steps
farther on: ‘She asked me whether I have two heads!' 
Met Miss R. 97 in the morning. Really an abysmal ugliness, a man could never
change so. Clumsy body, limp as if still asleep; the old jacket that I knew; what
she was wearing under the jacket was as indeterminable as it was suspect,
probably only her slip; and apparently she was disturbed by being discovered
in this state, but she did the wrong thing - instead of concealing what it was
that had given rise to her embarrassment, she reached as if guiltily inside the
neck of her jacket and jerked it into place. Heavy down on her upper lip, but
only in one spot; an exquisitely ugly impression. In spite of it all, I like her very
much, even in all her undoubted ugliness; the beauty of her smile hasn't
changed, the beauty of her eyes has suffered from the falling-off of the whole.
As for the rest, we are continents apart, I certainly don't understand her; she
on the other hand was satisfied with the first superficial impression she got of
me. In all innocence she asked me for a bread card. 
Read a chapter of The New Christians 98 in the evening. 
Old father and his elderly daughter. He reasonable, slightly stooped, with a
pointed beard, a little cane held behind his back. She broad-nosed, with a
strong lower jaw, round, distended face; turned clumsily on her broad hips.
‘They say I don't look well. But I do look well.'
