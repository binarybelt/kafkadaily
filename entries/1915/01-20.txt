20 January. The end of writing. When will it catch me up again? In what a badstate I am going to meet F.! The clumsy thinking that immediately appears
when I give up my writing, my inability to prepare for the meeting; whereas
last week I could hardly shake off all the ideas it aroused in me. May I enjoy the
only conceivable profit I can have from it - better sleep. 
Black Flags. How badly I even read. And with what malice and weakness I
observe myself. Apparently I cannot force my way into the world, but lie quietly,
receive, spread out within me what I have received, and then step calmly forth.
