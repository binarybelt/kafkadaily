14 May. Lost all regularity in writing. In the open a great deal. Walk to Troja
with Miss St., to Dobfichovice, Castalice with Miss R., her sister, Felix, his wife
and Ottla. As though on the rack. Church services on Teingasse today, thenTuckmachergasse, then the soup kitchen. Read old portions of ‘The Stoker'
today. A strength that seems unattainable (is already unattainable) today.
Afraid I am unfit because of a bad heart.
