3 November. Went about a great deal lately, fewer headaches. Walks with
Miss R. With her at Er und seine Schwester, played by Girardi. (‘Have you talent
then?' - ‘Permit me to intervene and answer for you: Oh yes, oh yes.’) In the
municipal reading-room. Saw the flag at her parents’. 
The two wonderful sisters, Esther and Tilka; they are like the contrast
between a light on and a light off. Tilka especially is beautiful; olive-brown,
lowered, curving eyelids, heart of Asia. Both with shawls drawn about their
shoulders. They are of average height, short even, and appear as erect and tall
as goddesses; one on the round cushion of the sofa, Tilka in a corner on some
unrecognizable seat, perhaps on a box. Half asleep, I had a long vision of
Esther, who, with the passion she impresses me as having for everything
spiritual, had the knot of a rope firmly between her teeth and swung
energetically back and forth in the empty room like the clapper of a bell (a film
poster I remember). 
The two L.'s. The little devil of a teacher whom I also saw in my half-sleep;
how she flew furiously along in a dance, a Cossack-like but floating dance, up
and down over a somewhat sloping, rough, dark brown brick pavement lying
there in the twilight.
