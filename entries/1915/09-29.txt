29 September. All sorts of vague resolves. That much I can do successfully. By
chance caught sight on Ferdinandstrasse of a picture not entirely unconnected
with them. A poor sketch of a fresco. Under it a Czech proverb, something like:
Though dazzled you desert the winecup for the maid, you shall soon come back
the wiser. 
Slept badly, miserably, tormenting headaches in the morning, but a free day. 
Many dreams. A combination of Marschner the director and Pimisker the
servant appeared. Firm red cheeks, waxed black beard, thick unruly hair. 
At one time I used to think: Nothing will destroy you, not this tough, clear,
really empty head; you will never, either unwittingly or in pain, screw up your
eyes, wrinkle your brow, twitch your hands, you will never be able to do more
than act such a role. 
How could Fortinbras say that Hamlet had prov'd most royally?In the afternoon I couldn't keep myself from reading what I had written
yesterday, ‘yesterday's filth’; didn't do any harm, though.
