14 April. The Homer class for the Galician girls. The one in the green blouse,
sharp, severe face; when she raised her hand she held it straight out in front of
her; quick movements when she put on her coat; if she raised her hand and
was not called on, she felt ashamed and turned her face aside. The sturdy
young girl in green at the sewing-machine.
