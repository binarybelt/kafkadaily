4 May. In a better state because I read Strindberg (Separated). I don't read him
to read him, but rather to lie on his breast. He holds me on his left arm like a
child. I sit there like a man on a statue. Ten times I almost slip off, but at the
eleventh attempt I sit there firmly, feel secure, and have a wide view. 
Reflection on other people's relationship to me. Insignificant as I may be,
nevertheless there is no one here who understands me in my entirety. To have
someone possessed of such understanding, a wife perhaps, would mean to
have support from every side, to have God. Ottla understands many things,
even a great many.; Max, Felix, many things; others, like E., understand only
details, but with dreadful intensity; F. in all likelihood understands nothing,
which, because of our undeniable inner relationship, places her in a very
special position. Sometimes I thought she understood me without realizing it;
for instance, the time she waited for me at the U-Bahn station - I had been
longing for her unbearably, and in my passion to reach her as quickly as
possible almost ran past her, thinking she would be at the top of the stairs, and
she took me quietly by the hand.
