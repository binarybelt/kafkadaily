7 October. Was a long time with Miss R. in the lobby of the hotel yesterday.
Slept badly. Headaches. 
I frightened Gerti by limping; the horror in a clubfoot. 102 
Yesterday a fallen horse with a bloody knee on Niklasstrasse. I looked away
and uncontrollably grimaced in the broad daylight. 
Insoluble problem: Am I broken? Am I in decline? Almost all the signs speak
for it (coldness, apathy, state of my nerves, distractedness, incompetence on
the job, headaches, insomnia); almost nothing but hope speaks against it.
