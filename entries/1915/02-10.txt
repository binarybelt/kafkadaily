10 February. First evening. My neighbour talks for hours with the landlady.
Both speak softly, the landlady almost inaudibly, and therefore so much the
worse. My writing, which has been coming along for the past two days, is
interrupted, who knows for how long a time? Absolute despair. Is it like this in
every house? Does such ridiculous and absolutely killing misery await me with
every landlady in every city? My class president's two rooms in the monastery.
It is senseless, however, to give way at once to despair; rather seek some
means, much as - no, it is not contrary to my character, there is still some tough
Jewishness in me, but for the most part it helps the other side.
