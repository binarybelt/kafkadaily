11 March. How time flies; another ten days and I have achieved nothing. It
doesn't come off. A page now and then is successful, but I can't keep it up, the
next day I am powerless. 
Eastern and Western Jews, a meeting. 94 The Eastern Jews' contempt for the
Jews here. Justification for this contempt. The way the Eastern Jews know the
reason for their contempt, but the Western Jews do not. For example, the
appalling notions, beyond all ridicule, by which Mother tries to comprehend
them. Even Max, the inadequacy and feebleness of his speech, unbuttoning
and buttoning his jacket. And after all, he is full of the best good will. In
contrast a certain W., buttoned into a shabby little jacket, a collar that it would
have been impossible to make filthier worn as his holiday best, braying yes and
no, yes and no. A diabolically unpleasant smile around his mouth, wrinkles in
his young face, wild and embarrassed movements of his arms. But the best one
is a little fellow, a walking argument, with a sharp voice impossible to
modulate, one hand in his pocket, boring towards the listeners with the other,
constantly asking questions and immediately proving what he sets out toprove. Canary voice. Tosses his head. I, as if made of wood, a clothes-rack
pushed into the middle of the room. And yet hope.
