5 November. State of excitement in the afternoon. Began with my considering
if and how many war bonds I should buy. Twice went to the office to give the
necessary order and twice returned without having gone in. Feverishly
computed the interest. Then asked my mother to buy a thousand kronen worth
of bonds, but raised the amount to two thousand kronen. In the course of all
this it was revealed that I knew nothing of an investment I possessed
amounting to some three thousand kronen, and that it had almost no effect at
all on me when I learned of it. There was nothing in my head save my doubts
about the war bonds, which didn't cease plaguing me even after a half-hour's
walk through the busiest streets. I felt myself directly involved in the war,
weighed the general financial prospects, at least according to what information
I possessed, increased or diminished the interest that would some day come to
me, etc. But gradually my excitement underwent a transformation, my
thoughts turning to writing, I felt myself up to it, wanted nothing save the
opportunity to write, considered what nights in the future I could set aside for
it, with pains in my heart crossed the stone bridge at a run, felt what I had
already experienced so often, the unhappy sense of a consuming fire inside me
that was not allowed to break out, made up a sentence - ‘Little friend, pour
forth' - incessantly sang it to a special tune, and squeezed and released a
handkerchief in my pocket in accompaniment as if it were a bagpipe.
