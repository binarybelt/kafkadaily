4 November. I remember a corner in Brescia were, on a similar pavement but
in broad daylight, I distributed soldi to the children. And a church in Verona I
forlornly and reluctantly went into, only because of the slight compulsion of
duty that a tourist feels, and the heavy compulsion of a man expiring of futility;
saw an overgrown dwarf stooped under the holy water font, walked around a
bit, sat down; and as reluctantly went out again, as if just such a church as this
one, built door to door with it, awaited me outside. 
The recent departure of the Jews from the railway station. The two men
carrying a sack. The father loading his possessions on his many children, the
smallest one as well, in order to mount the platform more quickly. The strong,
healthy, young, but already shapeless woman sitting on a trunk holding a
suckling infant, surrounded by acquaintances in lively conversation.
