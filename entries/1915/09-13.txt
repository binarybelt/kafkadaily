13 September. Eve of Father's birthday, new diary. I don't need it as much as I
used to, I mustn't upset myself, I'm upset enough, but to what purpose, when
will it come, how can one heart, one heart not entirely sound, bear so much
discontent and the incessant tugging of so much desire? 
Distractedness, weak memory, stupidity!
