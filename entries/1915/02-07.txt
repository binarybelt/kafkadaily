7 February. Complete standstill. Unending torments. 
At a certain point in self-knowledge, when other circumstances favouring self
security are present, it will invariably follow that you find yourself execrable.
Every moral standard - however opinions may differ on it - will seem too high.
You will see that you are nothing but a rat's nest of miserable dissimulations.
The most trifling of your acts will not be untainted by these dissimulations.
These dissimulated intentions are so squalid that in the course of your self
scrutiny you will not want to ponder them closely but will instead be content to
gaze at them from afar. These intentions aren't all compounded merely of
selfishness, selfishness seems in comparison an ideal of the good and
beautiful. The filth you will find exists for its own sake; you will recognize that
you came dripping into the world with this burden and will depart
unrecognizable again - or only too recognizable - because of it. This filth is the
nethermost depth you will find; at the nethermost depth there will be not lava,
no, but filth. It is the nethermost and the uppermost, and even the doubts self
scrutiny begets will soon grow weak and self-complacent as the wallowing of a
pig in muck.
