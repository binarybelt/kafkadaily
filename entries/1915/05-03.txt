3 May. Completely indifferent and apathetic. A well gone dry, water at an
unattainable depth and no certainty it is there. Nothing, nothing. Don't
understand the life in Strindberg's Separated; what he calls beautiful, when I
relate it to myself, disgusts me. A letter to F., all wrong, impossible to mail it.
What is there to tie me to a past or a future? The present is a phantom state for
me; I don't sit at the table but hover round it. Nothing, nothing. Emptiness,
boredom, no, not boredom, merely emptiness, meaninglessness, weakness.
Yesterday in Dobiichovice. 96
