6 November. View of the antlike movements of the crowd in front of and in
the trench. 103 
At the home of Oskar Pollak's 104 mother. His sister made a good impression
on me. Is there anyone, by the way, to whom I don't bow down? Take Griinberg,
105 for instance, who in my opinion is a very remarkable person and almost
universally depreciated for reasons which are beyond me - if it were a question,
let's say, of which of the two of us should have to die immediately (no great
improbability in his case, for they say he is in an advanced stage of
tuberculosis), and the decision lay with me as to which it should be, then I
should find the question a preposterous one, so long as it was looked at merely
theoretically; for as a matter of course Griinberg, a far more valuable person
than I, should have been spared. Griinberg too would agree with me. But in the
final desperate moment I should, as everyone else would have done long
before, invent arguments in my favour, arguments that at any other time,because of their crudity, nakedness, and falsity, would have made me vomit.
And these final moments I am surely undergoing now, though no one is forcing
a choice upon me; they are those moments when I put of? all external
distracting influences and try really to look into myself. 
‘Silently the “black ones” sit around the fire. The light of the flames flickers on
their sombre, fanatic faces.'
