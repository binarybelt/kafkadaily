21 November. Complete futility. Sunday. A more than ordinary sleepless night.
In bed in the sunshine until a quarter past eleven. Walk. Lunch. Read the paper,
leafed through some old catalogues. Walk, Hybernerstrasse, City Park,
Wenzelsplatz, Ferdinandstrasse, then in the direction of Podol. Laboriously
stretched out to two hours. Now and then felt severe pains in my head, once a
really burning pain. Had supper. Now at home. Who on high could behold all
this with open eyes from beginning to end?
