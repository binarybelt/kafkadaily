14 February. The infinite attraction of Russia. It is best represented not by a
troika but by the image of a vast river of yellowish water on which waves - but
not too high ones - are everywhere tossing. Wild, desolate heaths upon its
banks, blighted grass. But nothing can represent it; everything rather effaces it. 
Saint-Simonism.
