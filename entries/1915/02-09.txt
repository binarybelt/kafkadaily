9 February. Wrote a little today and yesterday. Dog story. 93Just now read the beginning. It is.ugly and gives me a headache. In spite of all
its truth it is wicked, pedantic, mechanical, a fish barely breathing on a
sandbank. I write my Bouvard et Pecuchet prematurely. If the two elements -
most pronounced in ‘The Stoker' and ‘In the Penal Colony' - do not combine, I
am finished. But is there any prospect of their combining? 
Finally took a room. In the same house on Bilekgasse.
