17 March. Harassed by noise. A beautiful, much more friendly room than the
one on Bilekgasse. I am so dependent on the view; there is a beautiful one
here, the Teinkirche. But a great deal of noise from the carriages down below;
however, I am growing quite used to it. But impossible for me to grow used to
the noise in the afternoon. From time to time a crash in the kitchen or thecorridor. Yesterday, in the attic above, perpetual rolling of a ball, as if someone
for some incomprehensible reason were bowling, then a piano below me in
addition. Yesterday evening a relative silence, worked somewhat hopefully
(’Assistant Attorney’), today began with joy, suddenly, next door or below me, a
party taking place, loud and fluctuating as though I were in its midst.
Contended with the noise awhile, then lay on the sofa with nerves virtually
shattered, silence aften ten o'clock, but can't work any longer.
