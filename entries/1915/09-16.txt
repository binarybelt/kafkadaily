16 September. Humiliation at X.'s. Wrote the first line of a letter to himbecause a dignified letter had taken shape in my head. None the less gave up
after the first line. In the past I was different. Besides, how lightly I bore the
humiliation, how easily I forgot it, how little impression even his indifference
made on me. I could have floated unperturbed down a thousand corridors,
through a thousand offices, past a thousand former friends now grown
indifferent, without lowering my eyes. Imperturbable but also unawakeable.
And in one office Y. could have been sitting, in another Z., etc. 
A new headache of a kind unknown so far. Short, painful stab above and to
the right of my eye. This morning for the first time, more frequently since. 
The Polish Jews going to Kol Nidre. The little boy with prayer shawls under
both arms, running along at his father's side. Suicidal not to go to temple. 
Opened the Bible. The unjust Judges. Confirmed in my own opinion, or at
least in an opinion that I have already encountered in myself. But otherwise
there is no significance to this, I am never visibly guided in such things, the
pages of the Bible don't flutter in my presence. 
Between throat and chin would seem to be the most rewarding place to stab.
Lift the chin and stick the knife into the tensed muscles. But this spot is
probably rewarding only in one's imagination. You expect to see a magnificent
gush of blood and a network of sinews and little bones like you find in the leg
of a roast turkey. 
Read Forster Fleck in Russland. Napoleon's return to the battlefield of
Borodino. The cloister there. It was blown up.
