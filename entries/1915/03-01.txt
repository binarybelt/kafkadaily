1 March. By a great effort, after weeks of preparation and anxiety, gave
notice; not entirely with reason, it is quiet enough, but I simply haven't done
any good work yet and so haven't sufficiently tested either the quiet or the lack
of it. I gave notice rather because of the lack of quiet in me. I want to torment
myself, want continually to change my situation, believe I foresee my salvation
in the change and in addition believe that by such petty changes, which others
make while they doze but I make only after having roused up all my faculties, I
shall be able to ready myself for the great change that I probably need. I am
certainly changing for a room inferior in many ways. Nevertheless, today was
the first (or the second) day on which I should have been able to work well, had
I not had a very severe headache. Have written a page in haste.
