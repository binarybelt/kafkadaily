14 September. With Max and Langer 99 at the wonder-rabbi's on Saturday.
Žižkov, 100 Harantova street. A lot of children on the pavement and stairs. An
inn. Completely dark upstairs, groped blindly along with my hands for a few
steps. A pale, dim room, whitish-grey walls, several small women and girls
standing around, white kerchiefs on their heads, pale faces, slight movements.
An impression of lifelessness. Next room. Quite dark, full of men and young
people. Loud praying. We squeezed into a corner. We had barely looked round
a bit when the prayer was over, the room emptied. A corner room, windows on
both sides, two windows each. We were pushed toward a table on the rabbi's
right. We held back. ‘You're Jews too, aren't you?' A nature as strongly paternal
as possible makes a rabbi. All rabbis look like savages, Langer said. This one
was in a silk caftan, trousers visible under it. Hair on the bridge of his nose.
Furred cap which he kept tugging back and forth. Dirty and pure, a
characteristic of people who think intensely. Scratched in his beard, blew his
nose through his fingers, reached into the food with his fingers; but when his
hand rested on the table for a moment you saw the whiteness of his skin, a
whiteness such as you remembered having seen before only in your childhood
imaginings - when one's parents too were pure.
