28 September. Completely idle. Memoirs of General Marcellin de Marbot, and
Holzhausen, Leiden der Deutschen 1812. 
Pointless to complain. Stabbing pains in my head by way of reply.A little boy lay in the bathtub. It was his first bath at which - as he had so long
wished - neither his mother nor the maid was present. In obedience to the
command now and then called out to him from the next room by his mother,
he hastily passed the sponge over his body; then he stretched out and enjoyed
his immobility in the warm water. 
The gas flame steadily hummed and in the stove the dying fire crackled. It
had long been quiet now in the next room, perhaps his mother had already
gone away. 
Why is it meaningless to ask questions? To complain means to put a question
and wait for the answer. But questions that don't answer themselves at the
very moment of their asking are never answered. No distance divides the
interrogator from the one who answers him. There is no distance to overcome.
Hence meaningless to ask and wait.
