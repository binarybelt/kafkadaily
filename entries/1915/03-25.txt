25 March. Yesterday Max's lecture, ‘Religion and Nation’. Tal-mudic Eastern
Jews. The girl from Lemberg. The Western Jew who has become assimilated to
the Hasidim, the plug of cotton in his ear. Steidler, a Socialist, long, shining,
neatly cut hair. The delight with which the Eastern European Jewesses take
sides. The group of Eastern Jews beside the stove. G. in a caftan, the matter-of
fact Jewish life. My confusion.
