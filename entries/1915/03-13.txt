13 March. An evening. At six o'clock lay down on the sofa. Slept until about
eight. Couldn't get up, waited for the clock to strike, and in my sleepiness
missed hearing it. Got up at nine o'clock. Didn't go home for supper, nor to
Max's either, where there was a gathering tonight. Reasons: lack of appetite,
fear of getting back late in the evening; but above all the thought that I wrote
nothing yesterday, that I keep getting farther and farther from it, and am in
danger of losing everything I have laboriously achieved these past six months.
Provided proof of this by writing one and a half wretched pages of a new story
that I have already decided to discard and then in despair, part of the blame for
which my listless stomach certainly shares, read Herzen in the hope that he
might somehow carry me on. His happiness the first year after he was married,
my horror of seeing myself in a similar happy state; the high life around him;
Belinski; Bakunin in bed all day long with his fur coat on. 
Occasionally I feel an unhappiness which almost dismembers me, and at the
same time am convinced of its necessity and of the existence of a goal to which
one makes one's way by undergoing every kind of unhappiness (am now
influenced by my recollection of Herzen, but the thought occurs on other
occasions too).
