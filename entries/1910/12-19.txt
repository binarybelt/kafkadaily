19 December. Started to work in the office. Afternoon at Max's. Read a little in Goethe's diaries. Distance already holds this life firm in tranquillity, these diaries set fire to it. The clarity of all the events makes it mysterious, just as a park fence rests the eye when looking at broad tracts of turf, and yet inspires inadequate respect in us. Just now my married sister 7 is coming to visit us for the first time.
