11 December. Thursday. Cold. With J. in Rieger Park, said not a word.
Seduction on the Graben. All this is too difficult. I am not sufficiently prepared.
It is the same thing, in a certain sense, as twenty-six years ago my teacher Beck
saying, of course without realizing the prophetic joke he was making: ‘Let him
continue in the fifth grade for a while, he still isn't strong enough; rushing him
in this way will have its consequences later on.' And in fact such has been my
growth, like a shoot forced too soon and forgotten; there is a certain hothouse
delicacy in the way in which I shrink from a puff of wind, if you like, even
something affecting in it, but that is all. Like Eleseus and his spring trips to the
cities. By the way, he is not to be underestimated: Eleseus could have become
the hero of the book, and in Hamsun's youth such would probably havehappened.
