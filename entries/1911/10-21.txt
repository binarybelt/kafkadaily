21 October. A counter-example: When my boss confers with me about officematters (today the filing-cabinet), I cannot look him in the eye for long withoutthere coming into my eyes against my will a slight bitterness which forceseither my look or his away. His look yields more briefly but more often to everyimpulse to look away, since he is not aware of the reason, but his glanceimmediately returns as he considers it all only a momentary fatigue of his eyes.I defend myself against it more vigorously, therefore hasten the zigzagging ofmy glance, look by preference along his nose and across to the shadows of hischeeks, often only keep my face towards him by the aid of the teeth andtongue in my tight-shut mouth - when I must, I lower my eyes, to be sure, butnever farther than to his tie, but get the most direct look immediately after heturns his eyes away, when I follow him closely and without consideration. 

The Jewish actors. Mrs Tschissik has protuberances on her cheeks near hermouth. Caused in part by hollow cheeks as a result of the pains of hunger,childbed, journeys, and acting, in part by the relaxed unusual muscles she hadto develop for the actor's movements of her large, what originally must havebeen a heavy mouth. Most of the time, as Sulamith, she wore her hair loose,which covered her cheeks so that her face sometimes looked like the face of agirl out of the past. She has a large, bony, moderately robust body and is tightlylaced. Her walk easily takes on a solemnity since she has the habit of raising,stretching and slowly moving her long arms. Especially when she sang theJewish national anthem, gently rocked her large hips and moved her arms,bent parallel to her hips, up and down with hands cupped as though she wereplaying with a slowly flying ball.
