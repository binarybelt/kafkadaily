14 December. My father reproached me at noon because I don't bother withthe factory. I explained that I had accepted a share because I expected profitbut that I cannot take an active part so long as I am in the office. Fatherquarrelled on, I stood silently at the window. This evening, however, I caughtmyself thinking, as a result of that noontime discussion, that I could put upwith my present situation very contentedly, and that I only had to be carefulnot to have all my time free for literature. I had scarcely exposed this thoughtto a closer inspection when it became no longer astonishing and alreadyappeared accustomed. I disputed my ability to devote all my time to literature.This conviction arose, of course, only from the momentary situation, but wasstronger than it. I also thought of Max as of a stranger despite the fact thattoday he has an exciting evening of reading and acting in Berlin; it occurs to menow that I thought of him only when I approached Miss Taussig's house on myevening walk. 

Walk with Lowy down by the river. The one pillar of the vault rising out of theElizabeth Bridge, lit on the inside by an electric light, looked - a dark massbetween light streaming from the sides - like a factory chimney, and the darkwedge of shadow stretching over it to the sky was like ascending smoke. The sharply outlined green areas of light at the side of the bridge.

The way, during the reading of Beethoven und das Liebespaar by W. Schafer,various thoughts (about dinner, about Lowy, who was waiting) unconnectedwith what I was reading passed through my mind with great distinctnesswithout disturbing my reading, which just today was very pure.
