9 December. Stauffer-Bern: ‘The sweetness of creation begets illusions aboutits real value.' 

If one patiently submits to a book of letters or memoirs, no matter by whom,in this case it is Karl Stauffer-Bern, one doesn't make him one's own by mainstrength, for to do this one has to employ art, and art is its own reward; butrather one suffers oneself to be drawn away - this is easily done, if one doesn'tresist - by the concentrated otherness of the person writing, and lets oneself bemade into his counterpart. Thus it is no longer remarkable, when one isbrought back to one's self by the closing of the book, that one feels the betterfor this excursion and this recreation, and, with a clearer head, remains behindin one's own being, which has been newly discovered, newly shaken up andseen for a moment from the distance. Only later are we surprised that theseexperiences of another person's life, in spite of their vividness, are faithfullydescribed in the book - our own experience inclines us to think that nothing inthe world is further removed from an experience (sorrow over the death of afriend, for instance) than its description. But what is right for us is not right forthe other person. If our letters cannot match our own feelings - naturally, thereare varying degrees of this, passing imperceptibly into one another in bothdirections - if even at our best, expressions like ‘indescribable’, ‘inexpressible’,or ‘so sad’, or ‘so beautiful’, followed by a rapidly collapsing ‘that' clause, mustperpetually come to our assistance, then as if in compensation we have beengiven the ability to comprehend what another person has written with at leastthe same degree of calm exactitude which we lack when we confront our ownletter-writing. Our ignorance of those feelings which alternately make uscrumple up and pull open again the letter in front of us, this very ignorancebecomes knowledge the moment we are compelled to limit ourselves to thisletter, to believe only what it says, and thus to find it perfectly expressed andperfect in expression, as is only right, if we are to see a clear road into what ismost human. So Karl Stauffer's letters contain only an account of the short lifeof an artist –
