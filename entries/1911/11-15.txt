15 November. Yesterday evening, already with a sense of foreboding, pulledthe cover off the bed, lay down, and again became aware of all my abilities asthough I were holding them in my hand; they tightened my chest, they set myhead on fire, for a short while, to console myself for not getting up to work, Irepeated: ‘That's not healthy, that's not healthy,' and with almost visiblepurpose tried to draw sleep over my head. I kept thinking of a cap with a visorwhich, to protect myself, I pulled down hard over my forehead. How much did Ilose yesterday, how the blood pounded in my tight head, capable of anythingand restrained only by powers which are indispensable for my very life and arehere being wasted. 

It is certain that everything I have conceived in advance, even when I was in agood mood, whether word for word or just casually, but in specific words,appears dry, wrong, inflexible, embarrassing to everybody around me, timid,but above all incomplete when I try to write it down at my desk, although Ihave forgotten nothing of the original conception. This is naturally related inlarge part to the fact that I conceive something good away from paper only in atime of exaltation, a time more feared than longed for, much as I do long for it;but then the fullness is so great that I have to give up. Blindly and arbitrarily Isnatch handfuls out of the stream so that when I write it down calmly, myacquisition is nothing in comparison with the fullness in which it lived, isincapable of restoring this fullness, and thus is bad and disturbing because ittempts to no purpose.
