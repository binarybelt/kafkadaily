12 October. Yesterday at Max's wrote in the Paris diary. 21 In the half-darkness of Rittergasse, in her autumn outfit, fat, warm R. whom we have known only inher summer blouse and thin, blue summer jacket, in which a girl with a not entirely faultless appearance is, after all, worse than naked. Then you reallywere able to see the large nose in her bloodless face and the cheeks to whichyou could have pressed your hands for a long time before any redness appeared, the heavy blonde down which heaped itself up on the cheek and upper lip, the railway dust which had strayed between the nose and cheek, andthe sickly whiteness where her blouse was cut away. Today, however, we ran after her respectfully, and when I had to make my farewells at the entrance to a house that went through to Ferdinandstrasse (I was unshaven and otherwise shabby in appearance), I afterward felt a few slight impulses of affection for her. And when I considered why, I had to keep telling myself: because she wasso warmly dressed.
