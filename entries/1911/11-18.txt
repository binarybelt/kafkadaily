18 November. Yesterday in the factory. Rode back on the trolley, sat in acorner with legs stretched out, saw people outside, lights in stores, walls ofviaducts through which we passed, backs and faces over and over again, ahighway leading from the business street of the suburb with nothing humanon it save people going home, the glaring electric lights of the railway stationburned into the darkness, the low, tapering chimneys of a gasworks, a posterannouncing the guest appearance of a singer, de Treville, that gropes its wayalong the walls as far as an alley near the cemeteries, from where it thenreturned with me out of the cold of the fields into the liveable warmth of thecity. We accept foreign cities as a fact, the inhabitants live there withoutpenetrating our way of life, just as we cannot penetrate theirs, a comparisonmust be made, it can't be helped, but one is well aware that it has no moral oreven psychological value, in the end one can often even omit the comparisonbecause the difference in the condition of life is so great that it makes it unnecessary. 

The suburbs of our native city, however, are also foreign to us, but in this casecomparisons have value, a half-hour's walk can prove it to us over and overagain, here live people partly within our city, partly on the miserable, dark edgeof the city that is furrowed like a great ditch, although they all have an area ofinterest in common with us that is greater than any other group of peopleoutside the city. For this reason I always enter and leave the suburb with aweak mixed feeling of anxiety, of abandonment, of sympathy, of curiosity, ofconceit, of joy in travelling, of fortitude, and return with pleasure, seriousness,and calm, especially from Zizkov.
