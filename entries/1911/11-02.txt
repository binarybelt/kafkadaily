2 November. This morning, for the first time in a long time, the joy again of imagining a knife twisted in my heart. 

In the newspapers, in conversation, in the office, the impetuosity of languageoften leads one astray, also the hope, springing from temporary weakness, fora sudden and stronger illumination in the very next moment, also mere strongself-confidence, or mere carelessness, or a great present impression that onewishes at any cost to shift into the future, also the opinion that true enthusiasmin the present justifies any future confusion, also delight in sentences that areelevated in the middle by one or two jolts and open the mouth gradually to itsfull size even if they let it close much too quickly and tortuously, also the slightpossibility of a decisive and clear judgement, or the effort to give further flowto the speech that has really ended, also the desire to escape from the subjectin a hurry, one's belly if it must be, or despair that seeks a way out for its heavybreath, or the longing for a light without shadow - all this can lead one astrayto sentences like: ‘The book which I have just finished is the most beautiful Ihave ever read,' or, ‘is more beautiful than any I have ever read’. 

In order to prove that everything I write and think about them is false, theactors (aside from Mr and Mrs Klug) have again remained here, as Lowy, whomI met yesterday evening, told me; who knows whether for the same reasonthey will not depart again today, for Lowy did not call at the office despite thefact that he promised to.
