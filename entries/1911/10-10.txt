10 October. Wrote a sophistic article for the Tetschen-Bodenbacher Zeitung forand against my insurance institute.

Yesterday evening on the Graben. Three actresses coming towards me from a rehearsal. It is so difficult quickly to become familiar with the beauty of three women when in addition you also want to look at two actors who are approaching behind them with that too-swinging actors' walk. The two - of whom the one on the left, with his fat, youthful face and open overcoat wrapped around his strong body, is representative enough of both - overtake the ladies, the one on the left on the pavement, the one on the right down in the roadway. The one on the left grasps his hat high up near the top, seizes it with all five fingers, raises it high and calls (the one on the right recollects himself only now): Good-bye! Good night! But while this overtaking and greeting has separated the gentlemen, the ladies addressed, as though led bythe one nearest the roadway who seems to be the weakest and tallest but alsothe youngest and most beautiful, continue on their way quite undisturbed, with an easy greeting which scarcely interrupts their harmonious conversation.The whole thing seemed to me at the moment to be strong proof thattheatrical affairs here are orderly and well conducted. 

Day before yesterday among the Jews in Caf6 Savoy. Die Seder-nacht by Feimann. At times (at the moment the consciousness of this pierced me) we did not interfere in the plot only because we were too moved, not because we were mere spectators.
