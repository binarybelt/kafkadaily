27 December. An unfortunate man, one who is condemned to have nochildren, is terribly imprisoned in his misfortune. Nowhere a hope for revival,for help from luckier stars. He must live his life, afflicted by his misfortune, andwhen its circle is ended must resign himself to it and not start out again to seewhether, on a longer path, under other circumstances of body and time, themisfortune which he has suffered could disappear or even produce somethinggood. 

My feeling when I write something that is wrong might be depicted asfollows: In front of two holes in the ground a man is waiting for something toappear that can rise up only out of the hole on his right. But while this holeremains covered over by a dimly visible lid, one thing after another rises up outof the hole on his left, keeps trying to attract his attention, and in the endsucceeds in doing this without any difficulty because of its swelling size, which,much as the man may try to prevent it, finally covers up even the right hole.But the man - he does not want to leave this place, and indeed refuses to atany price -has nothing but these appearances, and although - fleeting as theyare, their strength is used up by their merely appearing - they cannot satisfyhim, he still strives, whenever out of weakness they are arrested in their risingup, to drive them up and scatter them into the air if only he can thus bring upothers; for the permanent sight of one is unbearable, and moreover hecontinues to hope that after the false appearances have been exhausted, thetrue will finally appear. 

How weak this picture is. An incoherent assumption is thrust like a boardbetween the actual feeling and the metaphor of the description.
