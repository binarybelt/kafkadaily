31 October. Despite the fact that today I have read here and there in theFischer catalogue, in the Insel Almanach in the Rundschauy I am now pretty surethat, whether I have assimilated everything either thoroughly or casually, Ihave in any case defended myself against all harm. And I should have enoughself-confidence tonight if I didn't have to go out with Lowy again. 

When on Sunday afternoon, just after passing three women, I stepped into Max's house, I thought: There are still one or two houses in which I havesomething to do, there are still women walking behind me who can see meturn in on a Sunday afternoon at a house door in order to work, talk,purposefully, hurriedly, only occasionally looking at the matter in this way. Thismust not remain so for long. 

I read the stories of Wilhelm Schafer, especially when aloud, with the sameattentive enjoyment that I should get from drawing a piece of twine over mytongue. At first I did not like Valli 27 very much yesterday afternoon, but after Ihad lent her Die Missgeschickten and she had already read it a little while andmust already have been properly under the influence of the story, I loved herbecause of this influence and caressed her. 

In order not to forget it, should my father once again call me a bad son, I write it down that, in the presence of several relatives, without special occasion,whether it may have been simply to put me in my place, whether it wassupposedly to rescue me, he called Max a ‘meshuggener ritoch” 28 and thatyesterday, when Lowy was in my room, ironically shaking his body andcontorting his mouth, he referred to these strange people who were being letinto the house, what could interest one in a strange person, why one entersinto such useless relationships, etc. After all, I should not have written it down,for I have written myself almost into a hatred of my father, for which after all hehas given no occasion today and which, at least as far as Lowy is concerned, isout of all proportion to what I have written down as having been said by myfather, and which even increases because I cannot remember what was reallywicked in my father's behaviour yesterday.
