28 December. The torment that the factory causes me. Why didn't I objectwhen they made me promise to work there in the afternoons. No one usedforce to make me do it, but my father compels me by his reproaches, Karl byhis silence, and I by my consciousness of guilt. I know nothing about thefactory, and this morning, when the committee made an inspection, I stoodaround uselessly with my tail between my legs. I deny that it is possible for meto fathom all the details of the operation of the factory. And if I should succeedin doing it by endlessly questioning and pestering all those concerned, whatwould I have achieved? I would be able to do nothing practical with thisknowledge, I am fit only for spectacular performances to which the soundcommon sense of my boss adds the salt that makes it look like a really goodjob. But through this empty effort spent on the factory I would, on the otherhand, rob myself of the use of the few afternoon hours that belong to me,which would of necessity lead to the complete destruction of my existence,which, even apart from this, becomes more and more hedged in. 

This afternoon, while taking a walk, for the duration of a few steps I sawcoming towards me or crossing my path entirely imaginary members of thecommittee that caused me such anxiety this morning.
