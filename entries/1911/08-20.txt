20 August. I have the unhappy belief that I haven't the time for the least bit ofgood work, for I really don't have time for a story, time to expand myself inevery direction in the world, as I should have to do. But then I once morebelieve that my trip will turn out better, that I shall comprehend better if I amrelaxed by a little writing, and so try it again.

From his appearance I had a suspicion of the exertions which he had takenupon himself for my sake and which now, perhaps only because he was tired,gave him this certainty. A little more effort might have sufficed and thedeception would have succeeded, it succeeded perhaps even now. Did I defendmyself, then? Indeed, I stood stiff-necked here in front of the house, but - justas stiff-necked -1 hesitated to go up. Was I waiting until the guests came tofetch me with a song? 

I have been reading about Dickens. Is it so difficult and can an outsiderunderstand that you experience a story within yourself from its beginning,from the distant point up to the approaching locomotives of steel, coal, andsteam, and you don't abandon it even now, but want to be pursued by it andhave time for it, therefore are pursued by it and of your own volition run beforeit wherever it may thrust and wherever you may lure it. 

I can't understand it and can't believe it. I live only here and there in a smallword in whose vowel (‘thrust' above, for instance) I lose my useless head for amoment. The first and last letters are the beginning and end of my fishlikeemotion.
