24 August. Sitting with acquaintances at a coffee-house table in the open airand looking at a woman at the next table who has just arrived, breathingheavily beneath her heavy breasts, and who, with a heated, brownish, shiningface, sits down. She leans her head back, a heavy down becomes visible, sheturns her eyes up, almost in the way in which she perhaps sometimes looks ather husband, who is now reading an illustrated paper beside her. If one couldonly persuade her that one may read at most a newspaper but never amagazine beside one's wife in a coffee-house. After a moment she becomesaware of the fullness of her body and moves back from the table a little.
