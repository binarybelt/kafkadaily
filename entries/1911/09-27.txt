27 September. Yesterday on the Wenzelsplatz met two girls, kept my eye toolong on one while it was just the other, as it proved too late, who wore a plain,soft, brown, wrinkled, ample coat, open a little in front, had a delicate throatand delicate nose, her hair was beautiful in a way already forgotten - Old manwith loosely hanging trousers on the Belvedere. He whistles; when I look at himhe stops; if I look away he begins again; finally he whistles even when I look athim - The beautiful large button, beautifully set low oh the sleeve of a girl'sdress. The dress worn beautifully too, hovering over American boots. Howseldom I succeed in creating something beautiful, and this unnoticed buttonand its ignorant seamstress succeeded - The woman talking on the way to theBelvedere, whose lively eyes, independent of the words of the moment,contentedly surveyed her story to its end - The powerful half-turn of the neckof a strong girl.
