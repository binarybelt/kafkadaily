17 October. I finish nothing because I have no time and it presses so within me. If the whole day were free and this morning restlessness could mountwithin me until midday and wear itself out by evening, then I could sleep. Thisway, however, there is left for this restlessness only an evening twilight hour atmost, it gets somewhat stronger, is then suppressed, and uselessly andinjuriously undermines the night for me. Shall I be able to bear it long? And is there any purpose in bearing it, shall I, then, be given time? 

Napoleon is reminiscing at the royal table in Erfurt: When I was still a merelieutenant in the Fifth Regiment… (the royal highnesses look at each other inembarrassment, Napoleon notices it and corrects himself), when I still had thehonour to be a mere lieutenant … When I think of this anecdote the arteries inmy neck swell with the pride that I can easily feel with him and that vicariouslythrills through me. 

Again in Radotin: freezing, I then walked around alone in the garden, thenrecognized in an open window the children's nurse who had walked to this sideof the house with me.
