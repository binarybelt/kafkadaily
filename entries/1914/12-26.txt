26 December. In Kuttenberg with Max and his wife. How I counted on the four
free days, how many hours I pondered how best to spend them, and now
perhaps disappointed after all. Tonight wrote almost nothing and am in all
likelihood no longer capable of going on with ‘The Village Schoolmaster’, which
I have been working at for a week now, and which I should certainly have
completed in three free nights, perfect and with no external defect; but now, in
spite of the fact that I am still virtually at the beginning, it already has two
irremediable defects and in addition is stunted - New schedule from now on!Use the time even better! Do I make my laments here only to find salvation
here? It won't come out of this notebook, it will come when I'm in bed and it
will put me on my back so that I lie there beautiful and light and bluish-white;
no other salvation will come. 
Hotel in Kuttenberg Moravetz, drunken porter, tiny, roofed court with a
skylight. The darkly outlined soldier leaning against the railing on the second
floor of the building across the court. The room they offered me; its window
opened upon a dark, windowless corridor. Red sofa, candle light. Jacobskirche,
the devout soldiers, the girls' voices in the choir.
