10 February. Eleven o'clock, after a walk. Fresher than usual. Why? 
1 Max said I was calm. 
2 Felix is going to be married (was angry with him). 
3 I remain alone, unless F. will still have me after all. 
4 Mrs X.'s invitation; I think how I shall introduce myself to her. By chance I
walked in the direction opposite to my usual one, that is, Kettensteg, Hradcany,Karlsbriicke. Ordinarily I nearly collapse on this road; today, coming from the
opposite direction, I felt somewhat lifted up.
