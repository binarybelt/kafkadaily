15 February. How long this Saturday and Sunday seem in retrospect.
Yesterday afternoon I had my hair cut, then wrote the letter to BL, then was
over at Max's new place for a moment, then the parents' gathering, sat next to
L.W., then Baum (met Kr. in the tram), then on the way home Max's complaints
about my silence, then my longing for suicide, then my sister returned from the
parents' gathering unable to report the least thing. In bed until ten, sleepless,
sorrow after sorrow. No letter, not here, not in the office, mailed a letter to Bl.
at the Franz-Josef station, saw G. in the afternoon, walked along the Moldau,
read aloud at his house; his queer mother who ate sandwiches and played
solitaire; walked around alone for two hours; decided to leave Berlin Friday,
met Kohl, 66 at home with my brothers-in-law and sisters, then the discussion of
his engagement at Weltsch's (J. K.'s putting out the candles), then at home
attempted by my silence to elicit aid and sympathy from my mother; now my
sister tells me about her meeting, the clock strikes a quarter to twelve. 
At Weltsch's, in order to comfort his mother who was upset, I said: ‘I too am
losing Felix by this marriage. A friend who is married is none.' Felix said
nothing, naturally couldn't say anything, but he didn't even want to. 
The notebook begins with F., who on 2 May 1913 made me feel uncertain; this
same beginning can serve as conclusion too, if in place of ‘uncertain' I use a
worse word.
