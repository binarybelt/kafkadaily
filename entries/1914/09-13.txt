13 September. Again barely two pages. At first I thought my sorrow over the
Austrian defeats and my anxiety for the future (anxiety that appears ridiculous
to me at bottom, and base too) would prevent me from doing any writing. But
that wasn't it, it was only an apathy that forever comes back and forever has to
be put down again. There is time enough for sorrow when I am not writing. The
thoughts provoked in me by the war resemble my old worries over F. in the
tormenting way in which they devour me from every direction. I can't endure
worry, and perhaps have been created expressly in order to die of it. When I
shall have grown weak enough - it won't take very long -the most trifling worry
will perhaps suffice to rout me. In this prospect I can also see a possibility of
postponing the disaster as long as possible. It is true that, with the greatest
effort on the part of a nature then comparatively unweakened, there was little I
was able to do against my worries over R; but I had had the great support of
my writing in the first days of that period; henceforth I will never allow it to be
taken from me.
