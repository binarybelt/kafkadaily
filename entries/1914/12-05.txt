5 December. A letter from E. on the situation in her family. My relation to her
family has a consistent meaning only if I conceive of myself as its ruin. This is
the only natural explanation there is to make plausible everything that isastonishing in the relation. It is also the only connexion I have at the moment
with her family; otherwise I am completely divorced from it emotionally,
although not more effectually, perhaps, than I am from the whole world. (A
picture of my existence apropos of this would portray a useless stake covered
with snow and frost, fixed loosely and slantwise into the ground in a deeply
ploughed field on the edge of a great plain on a dark winter's night.) Only ruin
has effect. I have made F. unhappy, weakened the resistance of all those who
need her so much now, contributed to the death of her father, come between F.
and E., and in the end made E. unhappy too, an unhappiness that gives every
indication of growing worse. I am in the harness and it is my fate to pull the
load. The last letter to her that I tortured out of myself she considers calm; it
‘breathes so much calmness’, as she puts it. It is of course not impossible that
she puts it this way out of delicacy, out of forbearance, out of concern for me. I
am indeed sufficiently punished in general, even my position in my own family
is punishment enough; I have also suffered so much that I shall never recover
from it (my sleep, my memory, my ability to think, my resistance to the tiniest
worries have been weakened past all cure -strangely enough, the
consequences of a long period of imprisonment are about the same); for the
moment, however, my relationship to them causes me little suffering, at least
less than F. or E. There is of course something tormenting in the fact that I am
now supposed to take a Christmas trip with E., while F. will remain in Berlin.
