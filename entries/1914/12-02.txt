2 December. Afternoon at Werfel's with Max and Pick. Read ‘In the Penal
Colony' aloud; am not entirely dissatisfied, except for its glaring and
ineradicable faults. Werfel read some poems and two acts of Esther, Kaiserin von
Persien. The acts carry one away. But I am easily carried away. The criticisms
and comparisons put forward by Max, who was not entirely satisfied with the
piece, disturb me, and I am no longer so sure of my impression of the play as a
whole as I was while listening to it, when it overwhelmed me. I remember the
Yiddish actors. W.'s handsome sisters. The elder one leaned against the chair,
often looked at the mirror out of the corner of her eye, and then - as if she
were not already devoured by my eyes - gently pointed a finger to a brooch
pinned to her blouse. It was a low-cut dark blue blouse, her throat was covered
with a tulle scarf. Repeated account of something that happened at the theatre:
some officers kept saying to each other in a loud voice during Kabale und Liebe:
‘Speckbacher is cutting a figure by which they meant an officer leaning against
the side of a box. 
The day's conclusion, even before meeting Werfel: Go on working regardless
of everything; a pity I can't work today, for I am tired and have a headache,
already had preliminary twinges in the office this morning. I'll go on working
regardless of everything, it must be possible in spite of the office or the lack of
sleep. 
Dreamed tonight. With Kaiser Wilhelm. In the castle. The beautiful view. A
room similar to that in the Tabakskollegium. 85 Meeting with Matilde Serav.
Unfortunately forgot everything. 
From Esther: God's masterpieces fart at one another in the bath.
