31 July. I have no time. 78 General mobilization. K. and P. have been called up.
Now I receive the reward for living alone. But it is hardly a reward; living alone
ends only with punishment. Still, as a consequence, I am little affected by all
the misery and am firmer in my resolve than ever. I shall have to spend my
afternoons in the factory; I won't live at home, for Elli and the two children are
moving in with us. But I will write in spite of everything, absolutely; it is my
struggle for self-preservation.
