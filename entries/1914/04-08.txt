8 April. Yesterday incapable of writing even one word. Today no better. Who
will save me? And the turmoil in me, deep down, scarcely visible; I am like a
living lattice-work, a lattice that is solidly planted and would like to tumble
down. 
Today in the coffee-house with Werfel. How he looked from the distance,
seated at the coffee-house table. Stooped, half reclining even in the wooden
chair, the beautiful profile of his face pressed against his chest, his face almost
wheezing in its fullness (not really fat); entirely indifferent to the surroundings,
impudent, and without flaw. His dangling glasses by contrast make it easier to
trace the delicate outlines of his face.
