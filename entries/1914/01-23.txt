23 January. B., the chief auditor, tells the story of a friend of his, a half-pay
colonel who likes to sleep beside an open window: ‘During the night it is very
pleasant; but in the morning, when I have to shovel the snow off the ottoman
near the window and then start shaving, it is unpleasant' 
Memoirs of Countess Thiirheim: ‘Her gentle nature made her especially fond
of Racine. I have often heard her praying God that He might grant him eternal
peace.' 
There is no doubt that at the great dinners given in his honour at Vienna by
the Russian ambassador Count Rasumovsky, he (Suvorov) ate like a glutton the
food served upon the table without pausing for a soul. When he was full he
would get up and leave the guests to themselves. 
To judge by an engraving, a frail, determined, pedantic old man. 
‘It wasn't your fate,' my mother's lame consolation. The bad part of it is, that
at the moment it is almost all the consolation that I need. There is my weak
point and will remain my weak point; otherwise the regular, hardly varying,
semi-active life I have led these last days (worked at the office on a description
of our bureau's activities; A.'s worries about his bride; Ottla's Zionism; the girls'
enjoyment of the Salten-Schildkraut lecture; reading the memoirs of Thiirheim;
letters to Weiss and Lowy; proof-reading ‘Metamorphosis’) has really pulled me
together and instilled some resolution and hope in me.
