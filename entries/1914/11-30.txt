30 November. I can't write any more. I've come up against the last boundary,
before which I shall in all likelihood again sit down for years, and then in all
likelihood begin another story all over again that will again remain unfinished.
This fate pursues me. And I have become cold again, and insensible; nothing is
left but a senile love for unbroken calm. And like some kind of beast at the
farthest pole from man, I shift my neck from side to side again and for the timebeing should like to try again to have F. back. I'll really try it, if the nausea I feel
for myself doesn't prevent me.
