7 October. I have taken a week's vacation to push the novel on. Until today - it
is Wednesday night, my vacation ends Monday - it has been a failure. I have
written little and feebly. Even last week I was on the decline, but could not
foresee that it would prove so bad. Are these three days enough to warrant the
conclusion that I am unworthy of living without the office?
