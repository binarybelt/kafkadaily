14 February. There will certainly be no one to blame if I should kill myself,
even if the immediate cause should for instance appear to be F.'s behaviour.
Once, half asleep, I pictured the scene that would ensue if, in anticipation of
the end, the letter of farewell in my pocket, I should come to her house, should
be rejected as a suitor, lay the letter on the table, go to the balcony, break away
from all those who run up to hold me back, and, forcing one hand after
another to let go its grip, jump over the ledge. The letter, however, would say
that I was jumping off because of F., but that even if my proposal had been
accepted nothing essential would have been changed for me. My place is down
below, I can find no other solution, F. simply happens to be the one through
whom my fate is made manifest; I can't live without her and must jump, yet -
and this F. suspects - I couldn't live with her either. Why not use tonight for the
purpose, I can already see before me the people talking at the parents'
gathering this evening, talking of life and the conditions that have to be
created for it - but I cling to abstractions, I live completely entangled in life, I
won't do it, I am cold, am sad that a shirt collar is pinching my neck, am
damned, gasp for breath in the mist.
