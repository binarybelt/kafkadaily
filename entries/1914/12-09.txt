9 December. Together with E. K. of Chicago. He is almost touching.
Description of his placid life. From eight to half past five in the mailorder house.
Checking the shipments in the textile department. Fifteen dollars a week. Two
weeks' holiday, one week with pay; after five years both weeks with pay. For a
while, when there wasn't much to do in the textile department, he helped out
in the bicycle department. Three hundred bicycles are sold a day. A wholesalebusiness with ten thousand employees. They get all their customers by sending
out catalogues. The Americans like to change their jobs, they don't particularly
like to work in summer; but he doesn't like to change, doesn't see the point of
it, you lose time and money by it. So far he has had two jobs, each for five
years, and when he returns - he has an indefinite leave - he will go back to the
same job, they can always use him, but can always do without him too.
Evenings he generally stays at home, plays cards with friends; sometimes, for
diversion, an hour at the cinema, in summer a walk, Sunday a boat-ride on the
lake. He is wary of marriage, even though he is already thirty-four years old,
since American women often marry only in order to get divorced, a simple
matter for them, but very expensive for the man.
