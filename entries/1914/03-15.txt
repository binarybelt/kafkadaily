15 March. The students wanted to carry Dostoyevsky's chains behind his
coffin. He died in the workers' quarter, on the fifth floor of a tenement house.Once, during the winter, at about five o'clock in the morning, the half-clothed
maid announced a visitor to the student. ‘What's that? What did you say?' the
student, still half asleep, was asking, when a young man entered, carrying a
lighted candle that he had borrowed from the maid. He raised the candle in
one hand the better to see the student and lowered his hat in his other hand
almost to the floor, so long was his arm. 
Only this everlasting waiting, eternal helplessness.
