8 March. A prince can wed the Sleeping Beauty, or someone even harder to
win too, but the Sleeping Beauty can be no prince. 
It happened that when Grandmother died only the nurse was with her. She
said that just before Grandmother died she lifted herself up a little from the

back again and died. 
There is no doubt that I am hemmed in all around, though by something that
has certainly not yet fixed itself in my flesh, that I occasionally feel slackening,
and that could be burst asunder. There are two remedies, marriage or Berlin;
the second is surer, the first more immediately attractive. 
I dived down and soon everything felt fine. A small shoal floated by in an
upwards-mounting chain and disappeared in the green. Bells borne back and
forth by the drifting of the tide - wrong.
