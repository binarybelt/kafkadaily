11 February. Hastily read through Dilthe/s Goethe; tumultuous impression,
carries one along, why couldn't one set oneself afire and be destroyed in the
flames? Or obey, even if one hears no command? Or sit on a chair in the middle
of one's empty room and look at the floor? Or shout ‘Forward!' in a mountain
defile and hear answering shouts and see people emerge from all the bypaths
in the cliffs.
