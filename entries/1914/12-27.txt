27 December. A merchant was greatly dogged by misfortune. He bore it for a
long time, but finally was convinced that he could not bear it any longer, and
went to one learned in the law. He intended to ask his advice and learn what he
might do to ward off misfortune or to acquire the strength to bear it. Now the
scripture always lay open before this sage, that he might study it. It was his
custom to receive everyone who sought advice from him with these words: ‘I
am just now reading of your case at the same time pointing with his finger to a
passage of the page in front of him. The merchant, who had heard of this
custom, did not like it; it is true that in this way the sage both asserted the
possibility of his helping the supplicant, and relieved him of the fear that he
had been visited with a calamity which worked in darkness, which he could
share with no one and with which no one else could sympathize; but the
incredibility of such a statement was after all too great and had in fact deterred
the merchant from calling sooner on the man learned in the law. Even now he
entered his house with hesitation, halting in the open doorway.
