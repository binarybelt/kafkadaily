4 November. P. back. 83 Shouting excited past all bounds. Story about the mole
burrowing under him in the trenches which he looked upon as a warning from
heaven to leave that spot. He had just got away when a bullet struck a soldier
crawling after him at the moment he was over the mole - His captain. They
distinctly saw him taken prisoner. But the next day found him naked in the
woods, pierced through by bayonets. He probably had had money on him, they
wanted to search him and rob him of it, but he - ‘the way officers are' - wouldn't
voluntarily submit to being touched - P. almost wept with rage and excitement
when he met his boss (whom in the past he had admired ridiculously, out of all
measure) on the train, elegantly dressed, perfumed, his opera glass dangling
from his neck, on his way to the theatre. (A month later he himself did the
same with a ticket given him by this boss. He went to see Der ungetreue
Eckehart, a comedy.) 84 Slept one night in the castle of Princess Sapieha; one
night, while his unit was in reserve, right in front of the Austrian batteries; one
night in a peasant cottage, where two women were sleeping in each of the two
beds standing right and left against each wall, a girl behind the stove, and
eight soldiers on the floor - Punishment given soldiers. Stand bound to a tree
until they turn blue.
