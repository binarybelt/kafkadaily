1 November. Yesterday, after a long time, made a great deal of progress;
today again virtually nothing; the two weeks since my holiday have been
almost a complete loss - Part of the day - it's Sunday - has been beautiful. In
Chotek Park read Dostoyevsky's pamphlet in his own defence. The guard at the
castle and the corps headquarters. The fountain in the Thun palace - Much self
satisfaction all day. And now I completely balk at any work. Yet it isn't balking; Isee the task and the way to it, I simply have to push past small obstacles but
cannot do it - Toying with thoughts of F.
