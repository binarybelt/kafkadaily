14 December. My work goes forward at a miserable crawl, in what is perhaps
its most important part, where a good night would stand me in such stead. 
At Baum's in the afternoon. He was giving a pale little girl with glasses a piano
lesson. The boy sat quietly in the gloom of the kitchen, carelessly playing with
some unrecognizable object. Impression of great ease. Especially in contrast to
the bustling about of the tall housemaid, who was washing dishes in a tub.
