28 January. Lecture on the miracles of Lourdes. Free-thinking doctor; bares his
strong and energetic teeth, takes great delight in rolling his words. ‘It is time
that German thoroughness and probity stand up to Latin charlatanism.'
Newsboys of the Messager de Lourdes: ‘Superbe guerison de ce soir!’ ‘Guerison
affirmee!’ - Discussion: ‘I am a simple postal official, nothing more.' ‘Hotel del'Univers.' -Infinite sadness as I left, thinking of F. Am gradually calmed by my
reflections. 
Sent letter and Weiss's Gcdeere to Bl. 
Quite some time ago A.'s sister was told by a fortune-teller that her eldest
brother was engaged and that his fiancee was deceiving him. At that time he
rejected all such stories in a rage. I: ‘Why only at that time? It is as false today
as it was then. She hasn't deceived you, has she?' He: ‘It's true that she hasn't,
isn't it?'
