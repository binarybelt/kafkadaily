30 August. Cold and empty. I feel only too strongly the limits of my abilities,
narrow limits, doubtless, unless I am completely inspired. And I believe that
even in the grip of inspiration I am swept along only within these narrow limits,
which, however, I then no longer feel because I am being swept along.
Nevertheless, within these limits there is room to live, and for this reason I shall
probably exploit them to a despicable degree. 
A quarter to two at night. Across the street a child is crying. Suddenly a manin the same room, as near to me as if he were just outside the window, speaks.
‘I'd rather jump out of the window than listen to any more of that.' He
nervously growls something else, his wife, silent except for her shushing, tries
to put the child to sleep again.
