5 January. Afternoon. Goethe's father was senile when he died. At the time of
his father's last illness Goethe was working on lphigenie. 
‘Take that woman home, she's drunk,' some court official said to Goethe
about Christiane. 
August, a drunkard like his mother, vulgarly ran around with common
women. Ottilie, whom he did not love but was made to marry by his father for
social reasons. 
Wolf, the diplomat and writer. 
Walter, the musician, couldn't pass his examinations. Withdrew into the
Gartenhaus for months; when the Tsarina wanted to see him: ‘Tell the Tsarina
that I am not a wild animal.' ‘My conscience is more lead than iron.'Wolf's petty, ineffectual literary efforts. 
The old people in the garret rooms. Eighty-year-old Ottilie, fifty-year-old Wolf,
and their old acquaintances. 
Only in such extremes does one become aware of how every person is lost in
himself beyond hope of rescue, and one's sole consolation in this is to observe
other people and the law governing them and everything. How, outwardly,
Wolf can be guided, moved here or there, cheered up, encouraged, induced to
work systematically - and how, inwardly, he is held fast and immovable. 
Why don't the Tchuktchis simply leave their awful country; considering their
present life and wants they would be better off anywhere else. But they cannot;
all things possible do happen, only what happens is possible. 
A wine cellar had been set up in the small town of F. by a wine dealer from the
larger city near by. He had rented a small vaulted cellar in a house on the
Ringplatz, painted oriental decorations on the wall, and had put in old plush
furniture almost past its usefulness.
