1 September. In complete helplessness barely wrote two pages. I fell back a
great deal today, though I slept well. Yet if I wish to transcend die initial pangs
of writing (as well as the inhibiting effect of my way of life) and rise up into the
freedom that perhaps awaits me, I know that I must not yield. My old apathy
hasn't completely deserted me yet, as I can see, and my coldness of heart
perhaps never. That I recoil from no ignominy can as well indicate hopelessness
as give hope.
