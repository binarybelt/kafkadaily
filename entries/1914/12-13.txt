13 December. Instead of working - I have written only one page (exegesis of
the ‘Legend' 87 ) - looked through the finished chapters and found pans of them
good. Always conscious that every feeling of satisfaction and happiness that I
have, such, for example, as the ‘Legend’ in particular inspires in me, must be
paid for, and must be paid for moreover at some future time, in order to deny
me all possibility of recovery in the present. 
Recently at Felix's. On the way home told Max that I shall lie very contentedly
on my deathbed, provided the pain isn't too great. I forgot -and later purposely
omitted - to add that the best things I have written have their basis in this
capacity of mine to meet death with contentment. All these fine and very
convincing passages always deal with the fact that someone is dying, that it is
hard for him to do, that it seems unjust to him, or at least harsh, and the
reader is moved by this, or at least he should be. But for me, who believe that I
shall be able to lie contentedly on my deathbed, such scenes are secretly a
game; indeed, in the death enacted I rejoice in my own death, hence
calculatingly exploit the attention that the reader concentrates on death, have
a much clearer understanding of it than he, of whom I suppose that he will
loudly lament on his deathbed, and for these reasons my lament is as perfect
as can be, nor does it suddenly break off, as is likely to be the case with a real
lament, but dies beautifully and purely away. It is the same thing as my
perpetual lamenting to my mother over pains that were not nearly so great as
my laments would lead one to believe. With my mother, of course, I did not
need to make so great a display of art as with the reader.
