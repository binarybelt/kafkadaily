8 December. Yesterday for the first time in ever so long an indisputable ability
to do good work. And yet wrote only the first page of the ‘mother' chapter, 86
for I had barely slept at all two nights, in the morning already had had
indications of a headache, and had been too anxious about the next day. Again
I realized that everything written down bit by bit rather than all at once in the
course of the larger part (or even the whole) of one night is inferior, and that
the circumstances of my life condemn me to this inferiority.
