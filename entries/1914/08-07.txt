7 August. Even if you have not the slightest sensitivity to individual
differences, you still treat everyone in his own way. L. of Binz, in order to attract
attention, poked his stick at me and frightened me. 
Yesterday and today wrote four pages, trivialities difficult to surpass. 
Strindberg is tremendous. This rage, these pages won by fist-fighting. 
Chorus from the tavern across the way. I just went to the window. 
Sleep seems impossible. The song is coming through the open door of the
tavern. A girl's voice is leading them. They are singing simple love songs. I hope
a policeman comes along. There he comes. He stops in front of the door for a
moment and listens. Then calls out: ‘Landlord!' The girl's voice: ‘Vojti§ku.' 80 A
man in trousers and shirt jumps forward out of a corner. ‘Close the dodr! You're
making too much noise.' ‘Oh sorry, sorry,' says the landlord, and with delicateand obliging gestures, as if he were dealing with a lady, first closes the door
behind him, then opens it to slip out, and closes it again. The policeman (whose
behaviour, especially his anger, is incomprehensible, for the singing can't
disturb him but must rather sweeten his monotonous round) marches off; the
singers have lost all desire to sing.
