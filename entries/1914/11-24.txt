24 November. Yesterday on Tuchmachergasse, where they distribute old
clothing to the refugees from Galicia. Max, his mother, Mr Chaim Nagel. The
intelligence, the patience, the friendliness, the industry, the affability, the wit,
the dependability of Mr Nagel. People who, within their sphere, do their work
so thoroughly that you believe they could succeed in anything on earth - yet it
is part of their perfection too that they don't reach out for anything beyond
their sphere. 
The clever, lively, proud, and unassuming Mrs Kannegiesser from Tarnow,
who wanted only two blankets, but nice ones, and who nevertheless, in spite of
Max's influence, got only old, dirty ones, while the new blankets were put aside
for the better people in another room, together with all the best things. Then,
they didn't want to give her good ones because she needed them for only two
days until her linen arrived from Vienna; they aren't permitted to take back
used articles because of the danger of cholera. 
Mrs Lustig, with a lot of children of every size and her fresh, self-assured,
sprightly little sister. She spent so much time looking for a dress for a little girl
that Mrs Brod shouted at her: ‘Now you take this or you won't get anything.'
But then Mrs Lustig answered in an even louder shout, ending with a wide,
violent sweep of her arm: ‘The mitzveh [good deed] is worth more than all these
shmattes [rags].'
