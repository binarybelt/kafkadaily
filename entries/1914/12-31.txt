31 December. Have been working since August, in general not little and not
badly, yet neither in the first nor in the second respect to the limit of my ability,
as I should have done, especially as there is every indication (insomnia,
headaches, weak heart) that my ability won't last much longer. Worked on, but
did not finish: The Tnal ‘Memoirs of the Kalda Railway’, ‘The Village
Schoolmaster’, ‘The Assistant Attorney’, 89 and the beginnings of various little
things. Finished only: ‘In the Penal Colony' and a chapter of Der Verschottene 90
both during the two-week holiday. I don't know why I am drawing up this
summary, it's not at all like me!
