3 August. Alone in my sister's apartment. It is lower down than my room, it is
also on a side street, hence the neighbours' loud talking below, in front of their
doors. Whistling too. Otherwise complete solitude. No longed-for wife to open
the door. In one month I was to have been married. The saying hurts: You've
made your bed, now lie in it. You find yourself painfully pushed against the
wall, apprehensively lower your eyes to see whose hand it is that pushes you,
and, with a new pain in which the old is forgotten, recognize your own
contorted hand holding you with a strength it never had for good work. You
raise your head, again feel the first pain, again lower your gaze; this up-anddown motion of your head goes on without pause.
