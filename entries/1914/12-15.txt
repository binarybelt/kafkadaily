15 December. Didn't work at all. For two hours now have been looking
through new company applications for the office. The afternoon at B.'s. He was
somewhat offensive and rude. Empty talk in consequence of my debility,
blankness, and stupidity almost; was inferior to him in every respect; it is a long
time now since I have had a purely private conversation with him, was happy to
be alone again. The joy of lying on the sofa in the silent room without a
headache, calmly breathing in a manner befitting a human being. 
The defeats in Serbia, the stupid leadership.
