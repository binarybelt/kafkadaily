19 December. Yesterday wrote ‘The Village Schoolmaster' 88 almost without
knowing it, but was afraid to go on writing later than a quarter to two; the fear
was well founded, I slept hardly at all, merely suffered through perhaps three
short dreams and was then in the office in the condition one would expect.
Yesterday Father's reproaches on account of the factory: ‘You talked me into it.'
Then went home and calmly wrote for three hours in the consciousness that
my guilt is beyond question, though not so great as Father pictures it. Today,
Saturday, did not come to dinner, partly in fear of Father, partly in order to use
the whole night for working; yet I wrote only one page that wasn't very good. 
The beginning of every story is ridiculous at first. There seems no hope that
this newborn thing, still incomplete and tender in every joint, will be able to
keep alive in the completed organization of the world, which, like every
completed organization, strives to close itself off. However, one should not
forget that the story, if it has any justification to exist, bears its complete
organization within itself even before it has been fully formed; for this reasondespair over the beginning of a story is unwarranted; in a like case parents
should have to despair of their suckling infant, for they had no intention of
bringing this pathetic and ridiculous being into the world. Of course, one never
knows whether the despair one feels is warranted or unwarranted. But
reflecting on it can give one a certain support; in the past I have suffered from
the lack of this knowledge.
