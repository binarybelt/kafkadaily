3 November. In the afternoon a letter to E., looked through a story by Pick,
‘Der blinde Gast’, and made some corrections, read a little Strindberg, then
didn't sleep, home at half past eight, back at ten in fear of headaches which
had already begun; and because I had slept very little during the night, did not
work any more, partly too because I was afraid to spoil a fair passage I had
written yesterday. Since August, the fourth day on which I have written
nothing. The letters are the cause of it; I'll try to write none at all or only very
short ones. How embarrassed I now am, and how it agitates me. Yesterday
evening my excessive happiness after having read several lines by Jammes,
whom otherwise I don't care for, but whose French (it is a description of a visit
to a poet who was a friend of his) had so strong an effect on me.
