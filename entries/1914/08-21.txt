21 August. Began with such hope and was then repulsed by all three stories;
today more so than ever. It may be true that the Russian story ought to be
worked on only after The Trial. In this ridiculous hope, which apparently has
only some mechanical notion behind it of how things work, I start The Trial
again - The effort wasn't entirely without result.
