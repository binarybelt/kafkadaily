30 June. Hellerau to Leipzig with Pick. I behaved terribly. Couldn't ask a
question, answer one, or move; was barely able to look him in the eye. The
Navy League agitator, the fat, sausage-eating Thomas couple in whose house
we lived, Prescher, who took us there; Mrs Thomas, Hegner, Fantl and Mrs
Adler, the woman and the child, Anneliese, Mrs K., Miss P., Mrs Fantl's sister, K.,
Mendelssohn (the brother's child; Alpinum, cockchafer larvae, pineneedle
bath); tavern in the forest called Natura, Wolff, Haas; reading Narciss aloud in
the Adler garden, sightseeing in the Dalcroze house, evening in the tavern in
the forest, Bugra - terror after terror.Failures: didn't find the Natura, ran up and down Struvestrasse; wrong tram
to Hellerau; no room in the tavern in the forest; forgot that I was supposed to
get a telephone call from E. 74 there, hence went back; Fantl had left; Dalcroze
in Geneva; next morning got to the tavern in the forest too late (F. had
telephoned for nothing); decided to go not to Berlin but Leipzig; pointless trip;
by mistake, a local train; Wolff was just going to Berlin; Lasker-Schiiler
appropriated Werfel; pointless visit to the exhibition; finally, to cap it all, quite
pointlessly dunned Pick for an old debt in the Arco.
