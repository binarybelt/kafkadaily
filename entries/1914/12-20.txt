20 December. Max's objection to Dostoyevsky, that he allows too many
mentally ill persons to enter. Completely wrong. They aren't ill. Their illness is
merely a way to characterize them, and moreover a very delicate and fruitful
one. One need only stubbornly keep repeating of a person that he is simple
minded and idiotic, and he will, if he has the Dostoyevskian core inside him, be
spurred on, as it were, to do his very best. His characterizations have in this
respect about the same significance as insults among friends. If they say to one
another, ‘You are a blockhead,' they don't mean that the other is really a
blockhead who has disgraced them by his friendship; rather there is generally
mixed in it an infinite number of intentions, if the insult isn't merely a joke, or
even if it is. Thus, the father of the Karamazovs, though a wicked creature, is by
no means a fool but rather a very clever man, almost the equal of Ivan, and in
any case much cleverer than his cousin, for example, whom the novelist
doesn't attack, or his nephew, the landowner, who feels so superior compared
to him.
