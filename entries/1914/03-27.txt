27 March. On the whole passed in much the same way. 
Hass hurried to get aboard the ship, ran across the gangplank, climbed up on
deck, sat down in a corner, pressed his hands to his face and from then on no
longer concerned himself with anyone. The ship's bell sounded, people were
running along, far off, as though at the other end of the ship someone were
singing with full voice. 
They were just about to pull in the gangplank when a small black carriage
came along, the coachman shouted from the distance, he had to exert all his
strength to hold back the rearing horse; a young man sprang out of the
carriage, kissed an old, white-bearded gentleman bending forward under the
roof of the carriage, and with a small valise in his hand ran aboard the ship,
which at once pushed off from the shore. 
It was about three o'clock in the morning, but in the summer, and already half
light. Herr von Irmenhof's five horses Famos, Grasaffe, Tournemento, Rosina
and Brabant - rose up in the stable. Because of ˜the sultry night the stable door
had been left ajar; the two grooms slept on their backs in the straw, flies
hovered up and down above their open mouths, there was nothing to hinder
them. Grasaffe stood up so that he straddled the two men under him, and,watching their faces, was ready to strike down at them with his hoofs at their
slightest sign of awakening. Meanwhile the four others sprang out of the stable
in two easy leaps, one behind the other; Grasaffe followed them. 
Through the glass door Anna saw the lodger's room was dark; she went in
and turned on the electric light to make the bed ready for the night. But the
student was sitting half reclined upon the sofa, smiling at her. She excused
herself and turned to leave. But the student asked her to stay and to pay no
attention to him. She did stay, in fact, and did her work, casting an occasional
sidelong glance at the student.
