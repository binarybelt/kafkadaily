26 January. Unable to read Thurheim, though she has been my delight these
past few days. Letter to Miss Bl. now sent on its way. How it has hold of me and
presses against my brow. Father and Mother playing cards at the same table. 
The parents and their grown children, a son and a daughter, were seated at
table Sunday noon. The mother had just stood up and was dipping the ladle
into the round-bellied tureen to serve the soup, when suddenly the whole table
lifted up, the tablecloth fluttered, the hands lying on the table slid off, the soup
with its tumbling bacon balls spilled into the father's lap. 
The way I almost insulted my mother just now because she had lent EUi 65 Die
base Unsckuldy which I had myself intended to offer her only yesterday. ‘Leave
me my books! I have nothing else.' Speeches of this kind in a real rage. 
The death of Thurheim's father: ‘The doctors who came in soon thereafter
found his pulse very weak and gave the invalid only a few more hours to live.
My God, it was my father they were speaking of! A few hours only, and then
dead.'
