4 January. We had scooped out a hollow in the sand, where we felt quite
comfortable. At night we rolled up together inside the hollow, Father covered it
over with trunks of trees, scattering underbrush on top, and we were as well
protected as we could be from storms and wild beasts. ‘Father,' we would often
call out in fright when it had already grown dark under the tree trunks and
Father had still not appeared. But then we would see his feet through a crack,
he would slide in beside us, would give each of us a little pat, for It calmed us to
feel his hand, and then we would all fall asleep as it were together. In addition
to our parents we were five boys and three girls; the hollow was too small for
us, but we should have felt afraid if we had not been so close to one another at
night.
