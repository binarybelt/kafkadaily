4 August. When I rented the place for myself I probably signed something for
the landlord by which I bound myself to a two- or even six-year lease. Now he is
basing his demand on this agreement. My stupidity, or rather, my general and
utter helplessness. Drop quietly into the river. Dropping probably seems so
desirable to me because it reminds me of ‘being pushed’.
