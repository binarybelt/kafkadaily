Hi there! Welcome to the repo for the Neocities site, kafkadaily.com .

This is essentially a glorified database of Kafka's journal entries, from 1910-1923, including his travel diaries.

When you visit the site, you get greeted with a corresponding entry on that date in ascending order from 1910-1923.

If there is no entry on that date, you can choose from dates in other years, if applicable.
