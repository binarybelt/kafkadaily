        <h3>About this Site</h3>

          This site provides a database of all of Kafka's diary entries.<br><br>
          The premise is simple. When you visit this site, you're presented with a diary entry that matches the current day and month. It goes in order, starting from 1910, and will eventually reach 1923, the end of his journals.<br>
          For those days that he didn't write anything - as is expected with a diary - you're presented with several alternative options from different years.<br>
          He was most active in 1910-1912, but all of his diaries have wonderful, insightful, and very real passages.<br><br>
          When I attended Providence's <a href="https://necronomicon-providence.com/welcome/">NecronomiCon</a> in August 2024, I went to a panel on Kafka,
          and decided to create this site inspired by the insightful analysis of his life and works.<br><br>

          Thank you to my dad for gifting me the kafkadaily domain, and for his patience in me getting this set up.<br><br>
          Thank you to my dear friend <a href="https://twitter.com/NewEngOfficial/status/1679091027422871554">@NewEnglandOfficial</a> for attending the convention with me and supporting me throughout.<br><br>
          Finally, thank you to DoES Liverpool for providing a great workspace for me to finish this site in.
